1.32 Mobile data costs 
A study is conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. 
Based on a small sample of 19 mobile communications plans offered, the average cost per 
1000 MB of free monthly mobile data allowance is found to be $5.40, with a margin of error of $2.16. 
Explain how this margin of error provides an inferential statistical analysis.
--------

This is an example of inferential statistical analysis because it uses a sample (19 mobile plans) 
to make a prediction about the average cost across the entire population of mobile plans.

The reported average of $5.40 is the sample statistic, and the margin of error of $2.16 gives 
a likely range for the true population mean.

So, based on this sample, we estimate that the average cost per 1000 MB of all mobile data plans in the 
population is between $3.24 and $7.56, with a high level of confidence (typically 95%).

This range accounts for sampling variability and expresses the uncertainty inherent in using a small sample 
to estimate a population parameter.
