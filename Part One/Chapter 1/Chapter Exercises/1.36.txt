1.36 Support of labor unions 
The Gallup organization has asked opinions about support of labor unions since its
first poll in 1936, when 72% of the American population approved of them. 
In its 2018 poll, it found that support of labor unions was at 62%. 
The 2018 poll was based on a random sample of 1,024 adults aged 18 and older and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.

a. What is a range of likely values for the proportion of Americans who supported labor unions in 2018?

b. The statistics from Gallup mentioned in the exercise are an example of (i) descriptive statistics or (ii) inferential statistics?

c. The question in part a of this exercise is an example of 
(i) descriptive statistics or 
(ii) inferential statistics?
------------------

a.  The likely range of values for the proportion of Americans who supported labor unions in 2018 is: 
62% +-4% = [58%, 66%].

b. (ii) Inferential statistics - Because Gallup is using a sample to make generalizations about the U.S. population.

c. (ii) Inferential statistics - Because calculating a likely range for a population value involves inference beyond just the sample data.
