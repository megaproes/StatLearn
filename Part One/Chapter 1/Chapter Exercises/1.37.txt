1.37 How sample proportions vary from one sample to the next 
Refer to Activity 2 in Section 1.2 and the sampling Distribution for the Sample Proportion web app.

a. Repeat the activity, using a population proportion 'p' of 0.60: Generate at least 25 samples of size n = 10 each. 
Observe how the sample proportions of successes vary around 0.60. Write down the smallest and largest sample proportion you obtained in your 25
simulations. (Check the box Show Summary Statistics, which will show you the smallest and largest sample proportion simulated.)

b. Repeat part a, but now use a sample size of n = 100. (Hit the reset button to clear the simulation results from part a.) 
What are now the smallest and largest values of the sample proportions in your simulations?

c. From your simulations in parts a and b, which sample size (n = 10 or n = 100) do you think will lead to a smaller margin of error?

d. Repeat part b, but with a larger sample size yet, of n = 1,000. (In the app, click on Enter Numerical Values for n and p.) 
With a sample of size n = 1,000, the margin of error in estimating a population proportion of 0.6 is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Are any of your simulated sample proportions more than 3 percentage points (i.e., more than 0.03) away
from 0.6, i.e., less than 0.57 or larger than 0.63?

-----------
a. The smallest is 0.300 and the largest is 1.00; 
This shows high variability in small samples - some samples had only 3/10 successes, some had all 10/10!

b. The smallest was 0.500 and the largest is 0.710;
Now the variability is much smaller â€” proportions stay closer to 0.60.

c. Between n = 10 and n = 100, the sample size of n = 100 leads to a smaller margin of error.
Larger samples give more stable and precise estimates, so the spread of sample proportions is narrower.

d. With n=1000 the Min is 0.572 and Max is 0.631.
Only one sample slightly exceeded the upper margin (0.631), and none dropped below 0.57.

This confirms that with a large sample size (n = 1,000), the sample proportions tend to stay 
very close to the population proportion, and almost always fall within the expected margin of error.
------------

As sample size increases, the variability of sample proportions decreases, and the margin of error shrinks. 
This is exactly what we expect in inferential statistics.
