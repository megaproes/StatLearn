1.48 Choosing a random sample 
We mentioned in Section 1.2 that a simple example of random sampling is when a teacher puts each student’s name on slips of paper, places
them in a hat, shuffles them, and then draws names from the hat without looking. 
We can simulate such a process with the Random Numbers app available from the book’s website, www.ArtofStat.com. Access that app and
leave the minimum at 1, but choose your class size as the maximum. Number the members of the class consecutively, starting with 1. 
Choose as the number of samples to draw a number that is relatively small compared to the class size; e.g., 
when the class size is 30, select 5 as the sample size. Finally, check No for “Sampling with Replacement?” in the app.

a. Press the Generate button once. The numbers displayed indicate a random sample of the corresponding members of the class. 
Which numbers did you obtain?

b. Keep on pressing Generate multiple times to see how eventually all members have about the same chance of being included in the sample, 
indicated by the frequencies in the bar chart below. After pressing 20 times, how often was the number 2 selected? 
(To get the bars in the chart to have about equal height, you may have to press Generate many hundreds of times.)
--------

a. After pressing Generate once, the randomly selected numbers were:
3, 8, 9, 16, 20
These represent a random sample of 5 students from a class of 20.

b. After pressing Generate hundreds of times, number 2 was selected 22 times, or approximately 4.07% of the time.
As the number of repetitions increased, the selection frequency of each number approached 5%, indicating that every 
class member has an equal chance of being included in the sample over time - a key feature of simple random sampling.
