1.10 Is globalization good? 
The Voice of the People poll asks a random sample of citizens from different countries around
the world their opinion about global issues. 

Included in the list of questions is whether they feel that globalization helps
their country. The reported results were combined by regions. 

In the most recent poll, 74% of Africans felt globalization helps their country, whereas 38% of North Americans
believed it helps their country. 

(a) Identify the samples and the populations. 
(b) Are these percentages sample statistics or population parameters? Explain your answer.
------

a. The samples are the randomly selected people from Africa and North America who responded to the poll.
The populations are all people in Africa and all people in North America, respectively.

b. These percentages are sample statistics, because they were calculated from 
responses given by a subset (sample) of each population â€” not the entire population.
