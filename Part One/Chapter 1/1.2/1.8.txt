1.8 Interested in CCUS? The Chinese Academy of Sciences
and the Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning
conducted a survey of about 563 Chinese, with a tertiary
education, about their interest in reducing global warming.

In the survey conducted in 2013, one of the questions asked
was, “Are you interested in carbondioxide capture, usage, and geological storage (CCUS) technology?” 
The possible responses were very interested, more interested, little interested, not interested, or don’t know about it. 

The survey reported percentages (20, 55, 20, 3, 2) in these categories.
a. Identify the sample and the population.
b. Are the percentages quoted statistics or parameters? Why?
-----------

a. The sample is the 563 Chinese individuals with tertiary education who responded to the survey.
The population is all Chinese individuals with tertiary education, not just those surveyed.

b. The percentages are statistics, not parameters, because they are based on data from a sample, not the entire population.
