1.6 Description and inference

a. Distinguish between description and inference as reasons for using statistics. 
Illustrate the distinction, using an example.

b. You have data for a population, such as obtained in a census. 
Explain why descriptive statistics are helpful but inferential statistics are not needed.
-------

a. Description is summarizing the collected data.
Inference is using the data to make generalizations or predictions about a population.
For example, tracking the number of winning trades and their average PNL, risk-reward ratio, or slippage is descriptive statistics.
Predicting whether those metrics will continue in future trades is inferential statistics.

b. Descriptive statistics help summarize and understand the full data set, such as a complete census.
Since you already have data for the entire population, 
there’s no need to make inferences — you already know the full picture without having to estimate or predict.
