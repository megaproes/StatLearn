1.30 UW student survey 
In a University of Wisconsin (UW) study about alcohol abuse among students, 100 of the
40,858 members of the student body in Madison were sampled and asked to complete a questionnaire. 
One question asked was, “On how many days in the past week did you consume at least one alcoholic drink?” (Source:

a. Identify the population and the sample.
b. For the 40,858 students at UW, one characteristic of interest was the percentage who would respond “zero” to this question. 
For the 100 students sampled, suppose 29% gave this response. Does this mean that 29% of the entire population of UW students would
make this response? Explain.
c. Is the numerical summary of 29% a sample statistic or a population parameter?
-------------

a. The population is all 40,858 UW students at the Madison campus.
The sample is the group of 100 students who were selected and surveyed.

b. No, we cannot conclude that exactly 29% of the entire population would respond “zero.”
This value is an estimate based on a sample and is subject to sampling variability.
With a properly conducted random sample, we can say the true percentage in the population 
is likely close to 29%, but it may be somewhat higher or lower - especially considering the margin of error.

c. The 29% is a sample statistic, because it is a numerical summary calculated from a sample 
(the 100 students), not from the entire population.
