1.33 Breaking down Brown versus Whitman 
Example 2 of this chapter discusses an exit poll taken during the 2010 California gubernatorial election. 
The administrators of the poll also collected demographic data, which allows for further breakdown of the 3,889 voters from whom in-
formation was collected. 

Of the 1,633 voters registered as Democrats, 91% voted for Brown, with a margin of error of 1.4%. 

Of the 1,206 voters registered as Republicans, 10% voted for Brown, with a margin of error of 1.7%.

And of the 1,050 Independent voters, 42% voted for Brown, with a margin of error of 3.0%.

a. Do these results summarize sample data or population data?
b. Identify a descriptive aspect of the results.
c. Identify an inferential aspect of the results.

-------------

a. These results summarize sample data, because the information was collected from a sample of voters (not the entire population). 

b. The proportions of each group who voted for Brown (like 91% of Democrats, 10% of Republicans) are descriptive statistics, 
because they summarize the observed sample data.

c. The margins of error (like ±1.4%, ±1.7%, ±3.0%) are part of inferential statistics, because they help estimate 
how much the sample results might differ from the true population values.
