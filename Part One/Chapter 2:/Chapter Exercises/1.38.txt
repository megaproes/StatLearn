1.38 How sample means vary from one sample to the next

Activity 2 explored the sample-to-sample variability of sample proportions. 
In this exercise, we will explore how the sample mean, the average of all observations in a sample, varies from sample to sample. 
Open the Sampling Distribution for the Sample Mean (Discrete Population) web app from the bookâ€™s website, www.ArtofStat.com. 
From the first drop-down menu, select Fair Die. 
This shows the distribution of the outcome of rolling a fair die with numbers 1 through 6, each with probability 1/6. 
(We will learn more about such distributions in Chapter 5.) 

We can think of a sample as consisting of several observations of this die.
a. Set the value for the sample size equal to 2. This means we make two observations of this die, each of which is a number between 1 and 6. 
The average of the two observations can be 1 (if each die shows a 1), 1.5, 2, . . . , 5.5, and 6. 
Press the Draw Sample(s) button 25 times and observe how the sample average varies between these numbers. 
What is the smallest and largest average you simulated, and which average(s) appeared the most often? 
(Hint: Click the Show Summary Statistic check box to see the smallest and largest average simulated.)

b. Now, press the Reset button and move the slider for n to 20, for a sample of 20 observations of rolls of this die. 
Press Draw Sample(s) 25 times and observe how the sample average varies, but that now the variability
is much more restricted compared to the scenario in part a. What is now the smallest and largest average you simulated?
--------------------

a. The smallest average is 1.50 while the biggest is 5.5. The most often occurs 4.

b. The min is 2.85 and max is 4.30.
