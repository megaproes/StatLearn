2.40 Public transportation—center 
The owner of a company in downtown Atlanta is concerned about the large use of gas-
oline by her employees due to urban sprawl, traffic congestion, and the use of energy-inefficient vehicles such as SUVs.
She’d like to promote the use of public transportation. 
She decides to investigate how many miles her employees travel on public transportation during a typical day. 

The values for her 10 employees (recorded to the closest mile) are
0 0 4 0 0 0 10 0 6 0
a. Find and interpret the mean, median, and mode.
b. She has just hired an additional employee. He lives in a different city and travels 90 miles a day on public transport. 
Recompute the mean and median. Describe the effect of this outlier.
-------------

a.  
Mean:
Add all values:
0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 20
Divide by 10:
Mean = 20 / 10 = 2 miles

Median:
Sorted: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 10
Median = average of 5th and 6th values = (0 + 0) / 2 = 0

Mode:
The value that occurs most frequently:
	Mode = 0 (it appears 7 times)

Interpretation:
    Mean = 2 miles: This includes higher values, but is inflated by the 4, 6, and 10 mile commuters.
    Median = 0 miles: Reflects the typical employee - most don't use public transport at all.
    Mode = 0 miles: Confirms that most employees don’t commute via public transit.



b. New data: 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 6, 0, 90

New Mean:
Sum = 20 (original) + 90 = 110
Number of values = 11
Mean = 110 / 11 = 10 miles
 
New Median:
Full sorted list:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 10, 90
Median = 6th value = 0

Effect of the Outlier (90 miles):
    The mean jumps from 2 to 10, a huge shift, even though only 1 person takes such a long trip.
    The median stays the same (0) — it’s not affected by the outlier.
    This illustrates how the mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median is resistant.
