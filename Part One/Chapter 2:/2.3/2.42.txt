2.42 Baseball salaries 
The players on the New York Yankees baseball team in 2014 had a mean salary of $7,387,498 and a median salary of $5,500,000.6 
What do you think causes these two values to be so different (data in NYYsalary file on the book’s website)?
-----------

The difference between the mean and median suggests that the distribution of salaries is right-skewed.
This happens because a few players (like star athletes or top-tier veterans) likely earn extremely 
high salaries -— much higher than the rest of the team.

These outliers pull the mean upward, making it much higher than the median, even though most players earn closer to the median amount.
