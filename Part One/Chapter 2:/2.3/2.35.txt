2.35 Resistance to an outlier 

Consider the following three sets of observations:
Set 1: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
Set 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 100
Set 3: 8, 9, 10, 11, 1000
a. Find the median for each data set.
b. Find the mean for each data set.
c. What do these data sets illustrate about the resistance of the median and mean?
------------

a. Each has median 10.
b. Set1_mean = 10, Set2_mean = 27.6, Set3_mean = 207.6
c. These data sets show that the median is resistant to outliers - it stays the same even when extreme values are added.
The mean is not resistant - it is highly affected by large outliers and becomes distorted.
