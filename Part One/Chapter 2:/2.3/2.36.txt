2.36 Weekly earnings and gender 
In New Zealand, the mean and median weekly earnings for males in 2009 was $993 and $870, respectively, and for females, the mean and
median weekly earnings were $683 and $625, respectively. 

Does this suggest that the distribution of weekly earnings for males is symmetric, skewed to the right, or skewed to the left? 
What about the distribution of weekly earnings for females? Explain.
---------------

Males: Mean > Median -> Right-skewed

This suggests the distribution of male weekly earnings is skewed to the right.
That means while most males earn around or below the median ($870), a smaller number of high-income earners are pulling the mean upward.

Females: Mean > Median -> Right-skewed

The same pattern applies here: the distribution is right-skewed, though the gap between mean and median is a bit smaller.
This still indicates that a few higher-earning females are increasing the mean compared to the median.
