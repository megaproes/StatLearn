2.32 Median versus mean 
For each of the following variables, would you use the median or mean for describing the
center of the distribution? Why? (Think about the likely shape of the distribution.)
a. Salary of employees of a university
b. Time spent on a difficult exam
c. Scores on a standardized test
----------

a. Median since shape is likely to be skewed to the right, meaning most employees earn lower to mid-range salaries, 
and only a few top executives or specialists earn very high salaries.

b. Median. Most students will likely use most of the time allotted, clustering toward the higher end of the time range. 
But a few students may finish quickly, creating a longer left tail (lower times).

c. Mean. Standardized tests (like SATs, IQ tests, GREs, etc.) are often designed to produce a symmetric, 
bell-shaped (normal) distribution. Thatâ€™s how they ensure fairness and comparability.
