2.2 Common types of cancer in 2012 Of all cancer cases around the world in 2012, 13% had lung cancer, 11.9%
had breast cancer, 9.7% had colorectal cancer, 7.9% had prostate cancer, 6.8% had stomach cancer, and 50.7% had
other types of cancer (www.wcrf.org/int/cancer-facts-fig-ures/worldwide-data). 

Is the variable “cancer type” categorical or quantitative? Explain.
----------
 The variable "cancer type" is categorical because it classifies each case into a specific group or category 
 based on the type of cancer — such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and so on. 
 These are labels, not numbers, and we use them to sort or group the data rather than to perform mathematical operations.
