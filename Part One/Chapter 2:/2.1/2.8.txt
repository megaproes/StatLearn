2.8 Nominal/ordinal
a. Explain the difference between a nominal and ordinal categorical variable.
b. Give an example of each type.
--------

A nominal categorical variable is a variable that represents categories with no inherent or meaningful order. 
The categories are just labels used to classify data.

An ordinal categorical variable is a variable that also represents categories, but those categories have a logical or meaningful order. 
However, the differences between levels are not necessarily equal or measurable

Nominal examples:
    Gender (male, female, non-binary)

Ordinal examples:
