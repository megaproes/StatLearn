2.28 Blossom widths 
A data set (available on the book’s website) analyzed by the famous statistician R. A. Fisher
consisted of measurements of different varieties of iris blossoms. The following plots show histograms of the
widths of petals for two such species, Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.

a. Describe the shape of the distribution of setosa petal widths.
b. Describe the shape of the distribution of versicolor petal widths.
c. Of the 50 versicolor blossoms in the data set, approximately what percentage has a petal width less than 3.2 inches?
d. Is it possible to determine accurately the percentage of versicolor blossoms with a width of more than 3 inches? Why or why not?
-----------

a. It's symmetric. The histogram for Setosa petals is fairly symmetric, with most values concentrated in the center bin. 
There is no obvious skew in the distribution.

b. Left skewed.

c. Frequencies that goes less than 3.2 is (5 + 15 + ~25)/50 = 0.9 = 90%, meaning roughly 90% of whole blossoms has a width <= 3.2.

d. No, we cannot determine that precisely from the histogram.
The reason is that the histogram uses bin intervals (e.g., 2.8–3.2), 
so we only know how many values fall in that entire bin, not the individual values within it.

Since 3.0 falls within the 2.8–3.2 bin, we don’t know how many of those 25 values are greater than 3.0 and how many are less — that level of detail is lost when data is binned.
