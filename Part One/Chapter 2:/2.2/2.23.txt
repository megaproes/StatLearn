2.23 Histogram for sugar 
For the breakfast cereal data, the figure below shows a histogram for the sugar values in grams.

a. Identify the intervals of sugar values used for the plot.

b. Describe the shape of the distribution. What do you think might account for this unusual shape? 
(Hint: How else are the cereals classified in Table 2.3?)

c. What information can you get from the dot plot
(Exercise 2.18) or a stem-and-leaf plot of these data that you cannot get from this plot?

d. This histogram shows frequencies. If you were to construct a histogram by using the percentages for each in-
terval, how (if at all) would the shape of this histogram change?
-----------------

a. The histogram uses bins (intervals) of width 2 grams, starting at 0 and going up to 18 grams. The intervals are:
0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12-14, 14-16, 16-18

b. The distribution appears to be bimodal and slightly symmetric, with two visible peaks — one around 4–6g and another 
around 12–14g of sugar.
This unusual shape might be explained by the classification in the table: cereals are either Type A 
(popular with adults) or Type C (popular with children).

Adult cereals tend to have lower sugar, while children’s cereals often have higher sugar, which could naturally lead to this two-peak (bimodal) pattern.

с. idk.

d. No, the shape of the histogram would not change.
Replacing frequencies (counts) with relative frequencies or percentages would change the scale of the y-axis, 
but the overall shape and distribution pattern would stay exactly the same.
