2.16 Most popular museum 

Which museums are the most visited? The following table shows results for the top eight most visited museums around the world, 
according to the World Atlas website.

a. Is “museum visited” a categorical or a quantitative variable?
b. When creating a bar graph of these data, would it be most sensible to list the museums alphabetically or in
the form of a Pareto chart? Explain.
c. Does either a dot plot or a stem-and-leaf plot make sense for these data? Explain.
d. Use the Explore Categorical Data app (enter data as a frequency table) or other software to construct a bar graph for these data.

a. “Museum visited” is a categorical variable because each museum is a category or label, not a numerical measurement. 
We’re grouping by names of museums.

b. Pareto chart is preferred. Alphabetical order may look clean, but it doesn't help reveal trends.
A Pareto chart, which orders the bars from highest to lowest frequency, makes it easy to visually identify 
the most visited museums and compare them quickly.
Since the values are close together (e.g., 6.3M, 6.4M, 6.7M), sorting them helps avoid visual confusion.

c. No, neither is appropriate Dot plots and stem-and-leaf plots are best for quantitative numerical data, 
especially small datasets with repeated or similar values. Here, we're working with categorical labels and associated 
frequencies, so these plot types don't apply or help visually.

d.
