a. This dramatic downward trend strongly suggests that the vaccination introduced in the 1940s was 
highly effective in reducing the incidence of whooping cough.

The decline is steep and consistent over the 25 years following vaccine introduction.

b. Incidence was low in the 1980s–1990s but began rising in the 2000s and peaked sharply around 2012.
Although the disease was once well-controlled, the upward trend since around 2000 suggests that whooping cough is not fully eradicated.
So, while the vaccine was very effective initially, new challenges have reintroduced outbreaks.

c. No — a histogram would not help much.
A histogram shows the distribution of values, but it does not account for time.
Since we’re trying to evaluate the effect of a vaccine over time, a time plot is the appropriate tool.

A histogram might show two clusters (high in the early years, low later), but it wouldn’t show the gradual 
decline after vaccine introduction or the recent rise. So it cannot show trends or cause-effect timing, which are crucial here.
