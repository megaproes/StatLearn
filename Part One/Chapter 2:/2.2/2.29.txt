2.29 Central Park temperatures 
The first graph shows a histogram of the Central Park, New York, annual average temperatures from 1869 to 2018.
a. Describe the shape of the distribution.
b. What information can the time plot show that a histogram cannot provide?
c. What information does the histogram show that a time plot does not provide?
------------

a. It's symmetric. The histogram of annual average temperatures is roughly bell-shaped and symmetric, 
centered around 54°F. There’s no strong skew, and most temperatures fall between 52°F and 56°F.

b. Trends over time
    The time plot shows how temperatures change over the years, allowing us to:
    Observe long-term trends, such as global warming (an upward trend in recent decades).
    Detect cyclical patterns or fluctuations.
    Identify anomalies (e.g., unusually hot or cold years).

In contrast, the histogram only shows the overall frequency distribution, not when values occurred.

c. Shape and spread of the distribution.

The histogram gives a clear view of:
    The overall shape (e.g., symmetric, skewed)
    Frequencies of temperature ranges (e.g., how often temps fall between 53–54°F)
    Concentration and variability — where most values lie and how spread out they are

The time plot can show patterns over time, but it’s hard to quickly judge the overall shape or 
most frequent values just by looking at the noisy time line.
