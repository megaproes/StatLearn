2.15 Oil wells 
The pie chart shown (constructed using Excel) portrays the regional distribution of oil wells in the Middle East.
a. Do the slices of the pie portray (i) variables or (ii) categories of a variable?
b. Identify what the two numbers that are shown for each slice of the pie mean.
c. Without inspecting the numbers, would it be easier to identify the modal category by using this graph or the corresponding bar graph? Why?
----------------

a. (ii) 
The variable is “Country”, and each slice of the pie chart represents a category  of that variable (e.g., Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc.).
The pie slices do not represent different variables — they represent different values (categories) of the same variable.
So:
    Variable = Country (categorical)
    Categories = Oman, Saudi Arabia, etc.
    What’s shown = the count and proportion of oil wells in each category

b. The first number is the number of oil wells in that country.
The second number is the percentage of the total oil wells that this number represents — i.e., the country’s proportion of the whole.
For example, Oman has 4,918 wells, which accounts for 27% of the total.

c. In this case, either graph makes it easy to see that Oman is the modal category, because its slice (or bar) would be 
visually much larger than the others.
However, in situations where the differences between categories are small, a bar graph ordered by size 
(like a Pareto chart) makes it easier to compare and identify the highest value.

So overall, a bar graph is more effective in general, especially when clarity matters.
