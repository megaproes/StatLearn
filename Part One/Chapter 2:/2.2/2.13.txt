2.13 Global Warming 
In 2017, a survey was conducted comprising nationals from different countries across the globe.
Upon the question of how aerosols affect the climate, 28.0% responded in favor of albedo effect, 33.5% sup-
ported absorption of sunlight, and 29.5% stated altering occurrence of clouds. Of the remaining, 3.1% suggested
a complex mechanism that happens while 5.9% indicated being unaware of the reason. 

a. Display this information in a bar graph.
b. Which is easier to sketch relatively accurately, a bar chart or a pie chart?
c. What is the advantage of using a graph to summarize the results instead of merely stating the percentages for each source?
d. What is the modal category?
--------------

b. Bar chart. Because each bar represents a separate, equally spaced category with a measurable height, 
it is easier to estimate and compare values. Pie charts make it harder to judge small differences between similar-sized slices.

c. Graphs give an immediate visual understanding of data.
A graph allows patterns, such as which responses are most common or how categories compare, to be understood quickly and intuitively. 
It’s much faster for the eye to spot highs/lows than scanning a list of percentages.

d. The modal category is “Absorption of Sunlight,” with 33.5% of responses.
This is the most frequently chosen response in the survey.
