2.27 How often do students read the newspaper? 
One of the questions on the class survey from Chapter 1 asked:
“Estimate the number of times a week, on average, that you read a daily newspaper.”
a. Is this variable continuous or discrete? Explain.

b. The histogram shown gives results of this variable when this survey was administered to a class of 36 University of Georgia students. 
Report the (i) minimum response, (ii) maximum response, (iii) number of students who did not read the newspaper at all, and (iv) mode.

c. Describe the shape of the distribution.

d. Find the proportion (or percent) of students that read a newspaper at least 6 times per week, on average.
-------------

a. The number of times someone reads a newspaper is countable (0, 1, 2, …), with no fractional responses. 
So, it’s a discrete quantitative variable.

b. 
(i) 0 times per week
(ii) 9 times per week
(iii) 2 students
(IV) 3 times per week is the mode as it has the frequency of 8 students.

c. The histogram has a peak in the middle (at 3), and the frequencies taper off fairly evenly to both sides, 
suggesting a roughly symmetric shape. There is no obvious skew.

d. We find that 6 times per week was 2 students, 7 times the 4 students, 8 times 2 students and 9 only 1 students.
The sum of students as 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9 says that (9/36) * 100 = 25% or a qurter of students read newspapers at least 6 times per week.
