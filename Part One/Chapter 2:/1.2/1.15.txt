1.15 Graduate studies 
Consider the population of all undergraduate students at your university. 
A certain proportion have an interest in graduate studies. Your friend randomly
samples 40 undergraduates and uses the sample proportion
of those who have an interest in graduate studies to predict
the population proportion at the university. 

You conduct an independent study of a random sample of 40 undergraduates, 
and find the sample proportion of those are interested in graduate studies. 

For these two statistical studies,
a. Are the populations the same?
b. How likely is it that the samples are the same? Explain.
c. How likely is it that the sample proportions are equal?
Explain.
----------------

a. Yes, the populations are the same. 
Both studies are sampling from the same group - all undergraduate students at the university.

b. It is very unlikely that the samples are exactly the same. Since random sampling was used, the chance of selecting the exact same 40 individuals is extremely low.

c. It is somewhat likely that the sample proportions are similar, but not necessarily equal.
Due to natural random variation, the proportions may differ slightly, even though they are drawn from the same population.
