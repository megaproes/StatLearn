1.13 Age pyramids as descriptive statistics 
The figure shown is a graph published by Statistics Sweden. 
It compares Swedish society in 1750 and in 2010 on the numbers of
men and women of various ages, using age pyramids.

Explain how this indicates that
a. In 1750, few Swedish people were old.
b. In 2010, Sweden had many more people than in 1750
c. In 2010, of those who were very old, more were female than male.
d. In 2010, the largest five-year group included people born during the era of first manned space flight.

--------
a. In 1750, the top sections of the age pyramid are very narrow, showing that very few people lived to old age.

b. In 2010, every age group is significantly wider than the corresponding group in 1750, 
indicating that Sweden had a much larger population overall.

c. In 2010, among the oldest age groups (especially 80+), the female bars are much wider, 
indicating that more elderly people were women than men.

d. The largest five-year group appears to be 65–69, meaning those people were born between 1941 and 1945, 
around the World War II era, not during the era of first manned spaceflight (which began in 1961). 
So the group born during the space era would be those aged around 45–49 in 2010 — a smaller group.
