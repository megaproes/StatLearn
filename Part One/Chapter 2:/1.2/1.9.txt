1.9 Preferred holiday destination 

Suppose a student is interested in knowing the preferred holiday destinations of the
faculty members in their university. 

They are affiliated to the college of business and interview a few of the faculty mem-
bers about their preferred holiday destination. 

In this context, identify the:
 (a) subject, 
 (b) sample, 
 (c) population.
----------

a. A subject is an individual from whom data is collected. 
In this case, a single faculty member interviewed is the subject.

b. The sample is the group of faculty members who were actually interviewed by the student.

c. The population is all faculty members at the university, since thatâ€™s the full group the student is interested in learning about.
