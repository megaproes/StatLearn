1.16 Samples vary less with more data 
We’ll see that the amount by which statistics vary from sample to sample always depends on the sample size. 
This important fact can be illustrated by thinking about what would happen in repeated flips of a fair coin.
a. Which case would you find more surprising—flipping the coin five times and observing all heads or flipping
the coin 500 times and observing all heads?

b. Imagine flipping the coin 500 times, recording the proportion of heads observed, and repeating this ex-
periment many times to get an idea of how much the proportion tends to vary from one sequence to another. 
Different sequences of 500 flips tend to result in proportions of heads observed which are less variable
than the proportion of heads observed in sequences of only five flips each. Using part a, explain why you would expect this to be true.

c. We can simulate flipping the coin five times with the Sampling Distribution for the Sample Proportion web app mentioned in Activity 2. 
Access the app from the book’s website, www.ArtofStat.com, and set the population proportion to 0.5 (so that we are simulating
flipping a fair coin) and the sample size n to 5 (so that we are simulating flipping a coin five times). 
Then press Draw Sample(s) once. What proportion of heads (= successes) did you observe in these five flips? 
Press the Generate Sample(s) button 24 more times. What is the smallest and what is the largest sample proportion
you observed? Which sample proportion occurred the most often in these 25 simulations?

d. Press Reset and set the sample size n to 500 instead of 5, to simulate flipping the coin 500 times. Then press
Draw Sample(s) once. What proportion of heads (= successes) did you observe in these five flips? Press
the Generate Sample(s) button 24 more times. What is the smallest and what is the largest sample proportion you observed? 
(Hint: Check Show Summary Statistics to see the smallest and largest value generated.)

a. The second case (getting 500 heads in 500 flips) would be far more surprising because the probability of this 
happening is extremely small.  In contrast, getting 5 heads in 5 flips is much more likely by chance.

b. The 5-flip sequences are more variable because there's a higher chance of extreme outcomes (like all heads or no heads). 
In contrast, the 500-flip sequences tend to cluster closer to 50% heads, which is why their variability is lower. 
This supports the idea that larger samples lead to more stable estimates.

c. In my first simulation of 5 flips, I observed 2 heads (successes), giving a proportion of 2/5 = 0.4.
After 25 simulations:
    1. Smallest proportion observed: 0.0
    2. Largest proportion observed: 1.0
    3. Most frequently observed proportion: 0.6


    d. I reset the app and set the sample size to 500. My first observed proportion of heads was 0.514 (257 heads out of 500 flips). 
After 25 more simulations, the summary was:
	Mean: 0.499  
	Standard Deviation: 0.019  
	Min: 0.446  
	Q1: 0.492  
	Median: 0.502  
	Q3: 0.512  
	Max: 0.530  
	IQR: 0.020
So:
	Smallest proportion: 0.446
	Largest proportion: 0.530
	
This shows that with a larger sample size, the sample proportions vary less and stay much closer to the true proportion of 0.5.
