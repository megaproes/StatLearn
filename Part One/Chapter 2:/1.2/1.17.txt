1.17 Comparing polls 
The following table shows the result of the 2018 General Elections in Pakistan, along with
the vote share predicted by several organizations in the days before the elections. 
The sample sizes were typically above 2,000 people, and the reported margin of error was around plus or minus 2 percentage points. 
(The percentages for each poll do not sum up to 100 because of the vote share of other regional parties in a democratic setup.)
			Predicted Vote
Poll 					PML-N PTI
IPOR 					32     29
SDPI 					25     29
Pulse  Consultant 			27     30
Gallup Pakistan (Self) 		38     25
Gallup Pakistan (WSJ) 		36     24
Gallup Pakistan (Geo/Jang) 	34     26
Actual Vote 				24.4   31.8

a. The SDPI Poll Predicted that 29% were going to vote for PTI, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Explain what that means.

b. Do most of the predictions fall within 2% (the margin of error) of the actual vote percentages? Considering
the relative sizes of the sample, the population, and the other parties factor, would you say that these polls have good accuracy?

c. Access the Sampling Distribution for the Sample Proportion web app at www.ArtofStat.com (see Activity 2),
and set the population proportion to 32% (the actual vote share of PTI rounded to two significant digits) and the sample size 
to 3,000 (a typical sample size for the polls shown here). Press the Generate Sample(s) button 10 times to stimulate 
taking a poll of 3,000 voters 10 times. The bottom graph now marks 10 potential results obtained from exit polls of 3,000 voters under
this scenario. You can see the smallest and the largest value of these 10 proportions by checking the 
“Summary Statistics for Sample Distribution” box under Options.
What are the smallest and the largest proportions you obtained in your simulation of 10 exit points?
---------------

a. The SDPI poll predicted that 29% of voters would choose PTI, with a margin of error of ±2%.
This means that the true proportion of PTI supporters in the population was expected to fall within the interval [27%, 31%], 95% of the time.

b. The actual vote share for PTI was 31.8%. Only one prediction (Pulse Consultant, 30%) falls 
within the ±2% margin of error range of [29.8%, 33.8%].
Most of the other polls predicted values too low, indicating that most predictions were not accurate within the stated margin of error.
Factors such as regional vote shifts, undecided voters, or biases in sampling could explain the difference.

c. Using the simulation (p = 0.32, n = 3,000), the smallest proportion observed from 10 polls was 0.304, 
and the largest was 0.330. These results fall within about ±1.6% of the true value, confirming that polls with this 
sample size typically show a small but expected amount of variation.
