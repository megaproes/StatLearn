1.18 Margin of error and n 
A poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs for Global News. It was conducted between
May 18 and May 20, 2016, with a sample of 1005 Canadians.
It was found 73% of the respondents “agree” that the
Liberals should not make any changes to the country’s
voting system without a national referendum first (http:// globalnews.ca/news/). 

Find the approximate margin of error if the poll had been based on a sample of size: 
(a) n = 900 
(b) n = 1600 
(c) n = 2500. 
Explain how the margin of error changes as n increases
------------

a.
Using 10 simulations with sample size n = 900 and population proportion p = 0.73:
    Mean = 0.725
    Min = 0.700
    Max = 0.738
    Margin of error ≈ 2.5% to 3.8%
b.
With n = 1600:
    Mean = 0.726
    Min = 0.704
    Max = 0.746
    Margin of error ≈ 2.0% to 2.2%

c.
With n = 2500:
    Mean = 0.730
    Min = 0.720
    Max = 0.740
    Margin of error ≈ 1.0%

Conclusion:
As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. 
This is because larger samples reduce variability in sample estimates, making them more precise and closer to the true population value.
