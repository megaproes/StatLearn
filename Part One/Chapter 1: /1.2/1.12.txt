1.12 Level of inflation in Egypt 
An economist wants to estimate the average rate of consumer price inflation in Egypt in the
late 20th century. Within the National Bureau, they find records for the years 1970 to 2000, 
which they treat as a sample of all inflation rates from the late 20th century. 
The average rate of inflation in the records is 11.6. 

Using the appropriate statistical method, they estimate the average rate of inflation
in late 20th century Egypt was between 11.25 and 11.95.

a. Which part of this example gives a descriptive summary of the data?
b. Which part of this example draws an inference about a population?
c. To which population does the inference in part b refer?
d. The average rate of inflation was 11.6. Is 11.6 a statistic or a parameter?
----------------

a. The descriptive summary is where the average rate of inflation is stated to be 11.6, based on the collected sample data.

b. The inference is where the economist estimates the average rate of inflation to be between 11.25 and 11.95, 
applying statistical methods to the sample.

c. The population refers to all annual inflation rates in Egypt during the late 20th century, 
which the economist is trying to estimate based on available records.

d. The value 11.6 is a statistic, because it is a summary based on a sample of years (1970â€“2000), not the entire population.
