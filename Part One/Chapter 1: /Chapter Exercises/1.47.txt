1.47 Margin of error 
Refer to the Sampling Distribution for the Sample Proportion app used in Activity 2.

a. For a population proportion of 0.50, simulate one random sample of size 1,000. 
(In the app, click on Enter Numerical Values for n and p.) 
What is the sample proportion of successes? Repeat this for a total of 10 times, keeping track of the 10 sample
proportions you generate (the middle graph in the app shows the sample proportion in the subtitle).

b. The margin of error with a sample of size 1,000 is approximately 3 percentage points. 
Using each of the 10 sample proportions from part a as the midpoint, construct 10 intervals by adding or subtracting this
margin of error. Remember that the margin of error tells you how close to the population proportion the
sample proportion is likely to fall. 
How many of the 10 intervals you constructed actually contain the population proportion of 0.50?

c. Collect the 10 intervals from each member of the class. 
(If there are 20 students, 200 intervals will be collected.) 
What percentage of these intervals captured the actual population proportion, 0.50?
--------------

a. First sample gave p = 0.502. 

b. 
1. 0.507 +- 0.03 = [0.477, 0.537]
2. 0.510 +- 0.03 = [0.48, 0.54] 
3. 0.495 +- 0.03 = [0.465, 0.525]
4. 0.495 +- 0.03 = [0.465, 0.525]
5. 0.511 +- 0.03 = [0.481, 0.541]
6. 0.495 +- 0.03 = [0.465, 0.525]
7. 0.489 +- 0.03 = [0.459, 0.519] 
8. 0.515 +- 0.03 = [0.485, 0.545]
9. 0.492 +- 0.03 = [0.462, 0.522]
10. 0.509 +- 0.03 = [0.479, 0.539] 
So, all of 10 intervals contain the population proportion 0.5

c. If 20 students each produce 10 intervals (200 total), and weâ€™re using a 95% confidence level, then about 
95% of intervals should contain the true proportion.
So approximately 190 out of 200 intervals are expected to capture the population proportion of 0.50.
