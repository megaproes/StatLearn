Your university is interested in determining the proportion 
of students who would be interested in completing summer courses online, compared to on campus. 

A survey is taken of 100 students who intend to take summer courses.

a. Identify the sample and the population.
b. For the study, explain the purpose of using 
(i) descriptive statistics and 
(ii) inferential statistics.
----------

a. The population is all students at the university who intend to take summer courses.
The sample is the group of 100 students who were surveyed.

b. 
(i) Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the data collected from the sample, 
such as the proportion of students who prefer online courses vs. on-campus courses.

(ii) Inferential statistics are used to make generalizations about the entire population of 
summer-course students based on the sample data. 

This may include estimating the true proportion of students who prefer online courses, 
and calculating a margin of error to understand the potential accuracy of that estimate.
