1.31 Defence services 
The University Career Survey asked in 2021 whether you would join the defence forces 
if you got an opportunity. Of the 6,814 students who had an opinion about this, 
4,252 or 62.4% indicated that they would join the defence forces.

a. Describe the population of interest.
b. Explain how the sample data are summarized using descriptive statistics.
c. For what population parameter might we want to make an inference?
---------

a. The population of interest is all students at the university who have an opinion on whether they would join the defense forces.

b. The sample data (6,814 students with an opinion) is summarized using descriptive statistics, 
by calculating the proportion who would join: (4252/6814)*100 ~= 62.4%.

c. We may want to make an inference about the true proportion of all university students 
(or all students with an opinion) who would choose to join the defense forces if given the opportunity. 
This is the population parameter of interest.
