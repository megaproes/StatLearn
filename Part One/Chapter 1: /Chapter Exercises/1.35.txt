1.35 Website tracking 
Example 5 mentioned data collected on visitors to a website for one day in March. 
Identify the: 
(a) sample and potential population of interest for this study and 
(b) descriptive and inferential aspects of this study.
--------

a. The sample is the group of 85 visitors whose behavior was tracked on that specific day.
The population of interest could be all visitors to the website, either throughout the entire month of March or over a longer time frame

b. The descriptive aspect of the study involves summarizing characteristics of the sample, such as the average time spent on the website, 
the most commonly used browser, or age group distribution.

The inferential aspect involves using the sample data to make generalizations or predictions about the behavior and characteristics 
of all website visitors, not just those who visited on that one day. 
For example, we might estimate the average time most users spend on the site or the percentage of users who use a mobile browser.
