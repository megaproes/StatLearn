3.5 Hygiene awareness and ownership status 

The Egyptian Health Department, in its Health and Hygiene Awareness Survey, surveyed residents in about 400 blocks. The survey asked residents questions about their hygiene habits. 
Those who regularly dust their furniture were tagged as aware, and those who did not were tagged as unaware. 
The following table shows results from the 2018 survey, cross-tabulating subjects’ ownership status by whether they are aware or not.

                    Hygiene Awareness Status
Ownership         Aware     Unaware     Total
---------------------------------------------
Owner             6105       4119       10224
Tenant            4218       1388        5606
---------------------------------------------
Total            10323       5507       15830

a. Identify the response variable and the explanatory variable.

b. Repeat the cell counts of subjects who were (i) aware owners and (ii) aware tenants.

c. Can you compare the counts in part b to answer the question “Is there a difference between owners and tenants who are aware?” Explain.

d. Construct a contingency table that shows the conditional proportions of sampled residents who are aware or otherwise, given ownership status. Interpret.

e. Based on part d, does it seem that there is an association between ownership status and hygiene awareness? Explain by comparing the conditional proportions.
------------------

a. Response variable: Hygiene Awareness Status; Explanatory variable: Ownership. We want to see how hygiene awareness varies between owners and tenants.

b. (i) 6,105; (ii) 4,218

c. No, we cannot compare these raw counts directly because there are far more owners (10,224) than tenants (5,606) in the sample. Raw counts don't account for the different group sizes.

d. 
       Aware Unaware   Total     n
Owner  0.597   0.403     1     10224
Tenant 0.752   0.248     1      5606

Tenants show higher hygiene awareness (75.2%) compared to owners (59.7%), a difference of 15.5 percentage points.

e. Yes, there appears to be a strong association between ownership status and hygiene awareness. Tenants are significantly more likely to be hygiene-aware than owners (75.2% vs 59.7%).
