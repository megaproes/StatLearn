3.3 Does age limit vigorous activities? 

Every Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDAS), includes the question, 
“Does your age limit you now from doing vigorous activities, such as running, lifting heavy objects, participating in strenuous sports?”

The table uses the 2021 survey results cross-tabulating limitation on activities with age groups, measured as response to the question.

						Limitation on Activity
Age Group     Significantly Limited   Somewhat Limited   Not Limited   Total
30–40                     181                  139              496       816
40–50                     196                  175              285       656
50–60                     334                  264              139       737
Total                     711                  578              920     2,209

a. Identify the response variable and the explanatory variable.
b. Find the conditional proportions of limitations for each age group. Interpret and summarize the association between these variables by comparing some of the conditional proportions across age groups.
c. Overall, what proportion of people reported being significantly limited from participating in activities?
-------------

a. Response: "Limitation on Activity"; Explanatory: "Age Group". We try to estimate how different limitations compare between different age groups.

b. 
 			Significantly Limited 		  Somewhat Limited 		Not Limited 		Total
30-40                 0.222            			  0.170       		   0.608     		 1
40-50                 0.299            			  0.267       		   0.434     		 1
50-60                 0.453            			  0.358       		   0.189     		 1

There's a strong association between age and activity limitations. As age increases, the proportion of people significantly limited increases dramatically 
(from 22.2% in the 30-40 group to 45.3% in the 50-60 group), while those not limited decreases substantially (from 60.8% to 18.9%).

c. Overall, 711/2,209 = 0.322 or 32.2% of people reported being significantly limited from participating in activities.
