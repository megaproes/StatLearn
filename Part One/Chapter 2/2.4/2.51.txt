2.51 Shape of vaccine production? 
According to the Indian Medical Association, the median production of vaccine units in India in the first week of July 2021 was 864,000. 
Which of the following is the most plausible value for the standard deviation: -20,000, 100, 25,000, or 1,200,000? 
Why? Explain what is unrealistic about each of the other values.
------------

-20,000 is not valid — standard deviation can't be negative.
100 is too small for such a large number; it would mean the data barely varies at all, which isn’t realistic for large-scale production.
1,200,000 is too large — subtracting that from 864,000 gives a negative value, which isn’t possible since vaccine production can’t be negative.
So, ±25,000 is the most reasonable. It allows for natural variation without going into unrealistic extremes.
