2.58 Empirical rule and skewed, highly discrete distribution
The table below shows data on the number of times 20- to 24-year-old men have been married. (Source: Bureau of the Census report 2004, U.S. Department of Commerce.)
No.Times Count   Percentage
0 	    8,418     84.0
1 	    1,594     15.9
2 	       10     0.1
Total   10,022     100.0

a. Verify that the mean number of times men have been married is 0.16 and that the standard deviation is 0.37.
b. Find the actual percentages of observations within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean. 
How do these compare to the percentages predicted by the empirical rule?
c. How do you explain the results in part b?
