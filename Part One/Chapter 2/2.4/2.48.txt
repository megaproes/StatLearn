2.48 Traffic violations 
A company decides to examine the number of points its employees have accumulated in the
last two years on a driving point record system. A sample of 12 employees yields the following observations:
0 5 3 4 8 0 4 0 2 3 0 1

a. Find and interpret the range.
b. Find and interpret the standard deviation s.
c. Suppose 2 was recorded incorrectly and is supposed to be 20. Redo parts a and b with the rectified data and describe the effect of this outlier.
---------

a. Range is 8 - 0 = 8. 
The range tells us that the spread between the lowest and highest point values is 8.
However, it says nothing about how most data values are distributed â€” it's sensitive to outliers and not a robust measure of variability.

b. mean_{0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 8} = 23/10 = 2.3, 
s^2 = ((0 - 2.3)^2 + (0 - 2.3)^2 + (0 - 2.3)^2 + (0 - 2.3)^2 + (1 - 2.3)^2 + (2 - 2.3)^2 + (3 - 2.3)^2 + (4 - 2.3)^2 + (5 - 2.3)^2 + (8 - 2.3)^2) / 9 = 
= (21.16 + 1.69 + 0.09 + 1.69 + 5.29 + 10.89 + 32.49) / 9 = 73.3 / 9 = 8.21.
s ~= 2.87. 

The standard deviation is about 2.87, meaning that on average, employees' driving points differ from the mean by about 2.5 points.

c. mean_{0 0 0 0 1 3 4 5 8 20} = 41/10 = 4.1
s^2 = (... + 313.29)/9 = 39.34.
s ~= 6.27

Replacing the value 2 with 20 causes a major increase in both the mean (from 2.3 to 4.1) and the standard deviation (from 2.87 to 6.27).
This demonstrates how sensitive the standard deviation is to outliers, as it weights larger deviations much more heavily.
