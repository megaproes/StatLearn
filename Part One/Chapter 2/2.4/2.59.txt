2.59 Time spent using electronic devices 
A student conducted a survey about the amount of free time spent using electronic devices in a week. 

Of 350 collected responses, the mode was 9, the median was 14, the mean was 17, and the standard deviation was 11.5. 
Based on these statistics, what would you surmise about the shape of the distribution? Why?
-----------------

Since the mean is higher than the median, this suggests that the data is influenced by some unusually high values — which pull the mean upward. 

That’s a sign of a right-skewed distribution. 
The mode being lower than both the median and mean supports this as well, and the relatively 
large standard deviation points to a wide spread in the data, consistent with right skewness.
