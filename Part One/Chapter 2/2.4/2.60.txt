2.60 Facebook friends 

A student asked her coworkers, parents, and friends, “How many friends do you have on Facebook?” 
She summarized her data and reported that the average number of Facebook friends in her sample is 170 with a standard deviation of 90. 
The distribution had a median of 120 and a mode of 105.

a. Based on these statistics, what would you surmise about the shape of the distribution? Why?
b. Does the empirical rule apply to these data? Why or why not?
-------------

a. Since the mean is greater than the median, it suggests that the distribution is right-skewed. 
The mode is even lower than the median, which supports this. 
The large standard deviation also shows the data has a wide spread and likely includes extreme high values (outliers).

b. No, the empirical rule does not apply here. The data is not bell-shaped — it’s skewed — and the empirical rule only works well 
for distributions that are roughly symmetric and normal.
