2.53 Heights 
From the survey of college students from Georgia in Example 14, the males had x_mean = 71 and s = 3,
and the females had x_mean = 65 and s = 3.

a. Use the empirical rule to describe the distribution of heights for males.

b. The standard deviation for the overall distribution (combining females and males) was 4. 
Why would you expect it to be larger than the standard deviations for the separate male and female height distributions?
Would you expect the overall distribution still to be unimodal? Would the empirical rule apply?
---------------

a. About 68% of heights for males will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, so between 68 and 74 inches (71 ± 3). 
About 95% should fall within two standard deviations (65 to 77 inches), and about 99.7% within three standard deviations (62 to 80 inches).

b. The overall standard deviation is larger because the combined group includes both males (who tend to be taller) and 
females (who tend to be shorter), so there’s more variation overall.

I would not expect the combined distribution to be unimodal; it would likely be bimodal since males and females have different average heights. 
Since the overall distribution isn’t normal or unimodal, the empirical rule wouldn’t apply well to the combined data.
