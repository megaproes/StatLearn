2.93 Solar panels and electricity wastage 

In 2021, a society tabloid reported results of a survey of residents in a residential society. One question asked was, “Do you think installing solar panels had made residents waste electricity or not?” 

The figure shows how the tabloid reported the results for the respondents (2% of the residents did not respond).
a. Explain what’s wrong with the way this bar chart was constructed.
b. Explain why you would not see this error made with a pie chart.
------------

a. The primary issue is that the bar heights don't correspond to the percentages shown. The "Yes, wastage has increased" bar (68%) appears much taller than it should be relative to the "No, wastage has not increased" bar (30%). 

In a properly constructed bar chart, the 68% bar should be about 2.3 times taller than the 30% bar, but they appear to have roughly a 4:1 or 5:1 height ratio.
Additionally, the percentages only add up to 98% (68% + 30%), which makes sense since 2% didn't respond, but this should be noted or shown as a third category for completeness.

b. Pie charts prevent this error because they are constrained by geometry - the slices must add up to exactly 360 degrees (100% of the circle). 

This physical constraint forces the visual proportions to accurately represent the data proportions. You cannot make a slice larger or smaller without affecting the other slices, so the relative sizes are automatically correct. 
Bar charts, however, rely on the designer to correctly scale the bar heights, leaving room for manipulation or error.
