2.94 BBC license fee 

Explain what is wrong with the time plot shown of the annual license fee paid by British subjects for watching BBC programs. (Source: Evening Standard, November 29, 2006.)

The problem with the graph is that the vertical axis doesn’t start at zero. This makes the increase in the BBC license fee look much bigger than it really is. 

By starting the graph at £80 instead of £0, the rise in fees looks more dramatic and can mislead people into thinking the cost is increasing faster than it actually is. 

A fair graph should start the vertical axis at zero to show the true size of the changes.
