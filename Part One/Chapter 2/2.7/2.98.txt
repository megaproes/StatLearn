2.98 Dog characteristics 

The following graph shows the weight (in kg) and neck size (in cm) of dogs who are registered with the U.K. Kennel Club.

a. At first glance, the weight and neck size of the dogs seem to be correlated. Explain.

b. The article wanted to stress that “decrease in weight of dogs corresponds with the decrease in neck size of these dogs”. To portray this, the graph uses two different scales
on the left and right y-axis in the same plot (The labels for the curves alert you to this fact). 

However, the difference in scales is easy to overlook. Describe an alternative way to display these data.
---------------

a.
At first glance, weight and neck size seem strongly correlated because the lines follow a very similar shape and move downward together. 
However, this visual similarity is misleading because the graph uses two separate y-axes with different scales. 
The narrowing of each axis exaggerates the similarity, making the trends appear more closely aligned than they may actually be.

b.
To avoid this misleading impression, a better approach would be to standardize both variables (e.g., using z-scores) so they can be shown on the same scale. 
This would allow for a fair visual comparison of trends without relying on separate axes. 

Alternatively, using two separate graphs—one for weight and one for neck size—would also prevent confusion and make the data easier to interpret accurately.
