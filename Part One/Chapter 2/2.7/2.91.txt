2.91 Support for dairy farmers 

The pie chart shown was displayed in an article in The Westmorland Gazette (August 28, 2015) to show who are willing to pay more for
milk to help dairy farmers.

a. Pie charts can be tricky to draw correctly. Identify two problems with this chart.
b. From looking at the graph without inspecting the percentages, would it be easier to identify the mode using this graph or a bar graph? Why?
----------

a. Problems with this pie chart:
1. Algebraic Mistake: The percentages (13 + 86) do not add up to 100.
2. Incorrect proportional representation: The "Yes" slice (86%) should be much larger than the "No" slice (14%), but they appear roughly equal in size. 
In a properly drawn pie chart, the "Yes" slice should occupy about 86% of the circle (roughly 310 degrees), while the "No" slice should only occupy about 14% (roughly 50 degrees).

b. Mode identification:
A bar graph would be easier for identifying the mode without inspecting percentages. In a correctly drawn bar graph, the height differences would immediately show which category is most frequent. 

With this incorrectly drawn pie chart, you cannot visually determine which category is the mode because the slice sizes don't reflect the actual proportions. 
However, if the pie chart were drawn correctly, both graph types would make the mode equally apparent through visual comparison of areas (pie chart) or heights (bar graph).
