2.92 Enrollment trends 

Examples 19 and 20 presented graphs showing the total student enrollment at a U.S. university between 2004 and 2012 and the data for STEM major
enrollment during that same time period. The data are repeated here.
------------

a. Construct a graph for only STEM major enrollments over this period. Describe the trend in these enrollment counts. 
b. Find the percentage of enrolled students each year who are STEM majors and construct a time plot of the percentages.
c. Summarize what the graphs constructed in parts a and b tell you that you could not learn from Figures 2.19 and 2.20 in Examples 19 and 20.
-------------

a. STEM enrollment trend (raw counts):
The trend shows a significant decline in STEM major enrollments from 2004 to 2007, dropping from approximately 2000 to about 1750 students. 
From 2007 onwards, the enrollment stabilizes and shows some consolidation, with slight fluctuations but generally remaining in the 1750-1900 range through 2012.

b. Looking at image, the percentage of students who are STEM majors shows a more dramatic decline than the raw counts suggest. 
The percentage drops consistently from about 6.8% in 2004 to approximately 5.5% in 2012, with only brief periods of stabilization.

c. 
1. Relative vs. absolute decline: While raw STEM enrollment declined and then stabilized, the percentage of STEM majors continued declining throughout the period, indicating that STEM enrollment 
grew slower than total university enrollment.

2. Accurate visual representation: Unlike Figure 2.19's misleading human figures that distorted proportions, these properly scaled line graphs allow for accurate trend analysis.

3. Context matters: The percentage graph (part b) shows that STEM's share of total enrollment consistently decreased, suggesting the university's growth was primarily in non-STEM fields, 
which wouldn't be obvious from looking at raw STEM numbers alone.
