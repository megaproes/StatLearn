2.95 Federal government spending 

Explain what is wrong with the following pie chart, which depicts the federal government breakdown by category for 2010.
-------

The main issue with this pie chart is incorrect proportional representation. In a pie chart, the size of each slice should match its percentage of the total. 

However, in this chart, some slices appear much larger or smaller than they should be based on the numbers. For example, the "Other" category (18%) looks smaller than "Unemployment and Welfare" (16%), 
and "Defense" (19%) appears almost the same size as "Medicare" (13%), even though they should be visually different. This makes the chart misleading and hard to interpret accurately.
