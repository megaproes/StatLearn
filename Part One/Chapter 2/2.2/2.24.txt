2.24 Shape of the histogram 
For each of the following variables, indicate whether you would expect its histogram to
be symmetric, skewed to the right, or skewed to the left. Explain why.

a. The price of a certain model of smartwatch in different stores in your district.
b. The amount of time taken by students to complete an exam at your school.
c. The grade point average (GPA) of your academic program this year.
d. The salary of all the employees in a company.
-------------

a. Roughly symmetric
b. Skewed to the left. Many students might take the full allotted time (or nearly so), while only some finish much earlier. 

c. Skewed to the left
d. skewed to the right. Most employees earn lower to mid-range salaries, and only a few top executives or 
specialists earn very high salaries, which pulls the right tail out.
