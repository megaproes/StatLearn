Repeat the preceding exercise for the following.
a. The winner’s score at a basketball game during an NBA season.
b. The distance from home to school for students attending a specific school.
c. The number of attempts a young adult needs to pass a driving license test.
d. The number of times an individual requests a password reset for the forgotten password of their email account.
---------------

a. Symmetric. 

b. Right skewed. Most students live close to school, so distances cluster at the lower end. 
A few students might live farther away and commute longer distances, forming a long right tail.

c. Right skewed. Most pass on their first or second attempt, but some might need more tries - a long right tail 
with fewer people as the number of attempts increases.

d. Right skewed. Most people request a reset rarely (0–1 times). A few might forget more frequently or have bad 
memory habits, but that's rare.
