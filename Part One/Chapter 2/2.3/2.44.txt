2.44 Fertility statistics 
The fertility rates (mean number of children per adult woman) from Exercise 2.21 are shown again in the table.
a. Find the median of the fertility rates. Interpret.
b. Find the mean of the fertility rates. Interpret.
c. For each woman, the number of children is a whole number, such as 2 or 3. 
Explain why it makes sense to measure a mean number of children per adult woman (which is not a whole number) to 
compare fertility levels, such as the fertility levels of 1.5 in Canada and 2.2 in Mexico.

Country  Fertility   Country      Fertility
Austria    1.5       Netherlands    1.7
Belgium    1.7       Norway         1.7
Denmark    1.8       Spain          1.3
Finland    1.6       Sweden         1.6
France     1.9       Switzerland    1.5
Germany    1.6       United Kingdom 1.8
Greece     1.4       United States  1.8
Ireland    1.8       Canada         1.5
Italy      1.3       Mexico         2.2

a. (1.3, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.9, 2.2)_median = (1.6 + 1.7) / 2 = 1.65
The median fertility rate among these countries is 1.65 children per adult woman, which means half the countries have a 
fertility rate below 1.65 and half above. It represents a typical value for the group.

b. mean is (30.1 / 18) = 1.672. The average number of children per adult woman across these countries is approximately 1.67.
Since the mean and median are close, this suggests the distribution is roughly symmetric (no strong skew).

c. While individual women can only have whole numbers of children, the mean fertility rate is an average across a population.
It tells us the expected number of children per woman in a large group, which helps compare overall fertility levels between countries.

Example:
    In Canada, a fertility rate of 1.5 means that for every 100 women, there are approximately 150 children.
    In Mexico, a fertility rate of 2.2 means 220 children per 100 women — showing a higher population growth trend.

So even though 1.5 or 2.2 isn’t possible for one person, it’s a very meaningful and accurate measure at the population level.
