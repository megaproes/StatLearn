2.33 More median versus mean 
For each of the following variables, would you use the median or mean for describ-
ing the center of the distribution? Why? (Think about the likely shape of the distribution.)
a. Amount of liquid in bottles of capacity one liter
b. The salary of all the employees in a company
c. The number of requests to reset passwords for individual email accounts
----------

a. Mean.This distribution is likely symmetric and tightly clustered around 1 liter because manufacturing processes are 
designed to be highly consistent and precise.
There are no extreme outliers, so the mean accurately reflects the center of the distribution.

b. Median. Salaries are right-skewed. A few very high earners (like executives) pull the mean upward.
The median better reflects what a "typical" employee earns.

c. Median. Most people reset their password 0â€“1 times, but a few users may reset it dozens of times - making the 
distribution strongly right-skewed.
These extreme values would inflate the mean, so the median is a more accurate description of the center.
