2.34 More on CO2 emissions 
The Energy Information Agency reported the CO2 emissions (measured in gigatons, Gt) from fossil fuel combustion for the top 
10 emitting countries in 2011. 
These are China (8 Gt), the United States (5.3 Gt), India (1.8 Gt), Russia (1.7 Gt), Japan (1.2 Gt), Germany (0.8 Gt), 
Korea (0.6 Gt), Canada (0.5 Gt), Iran (0.4 Gt), and Saudi Arabia (0.4 Gt).
a. Find the mean and median CO2 emission.
b. The totals reported here do not take into account a nation’s population size. 
Explain why it may be more sensible to analyze per capita values, as was done in Example 11.
------------------

a. 
Mean = (8 + 5.3 + 1.8 + 1.7 + 1.2 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.4) / 10 = 2.07 Gt
Median = (1.2 + 0.8) / 2 = 1

b. Analyzing total CO₂ emissions alone doesn't account for population size. 
A large country like China or India naturally emits more CO₂ just because it has more people.

Per capita emissions (emissions per person) are a fairer way to compare countries because they reflect the average individual’s contribution to emissions.
