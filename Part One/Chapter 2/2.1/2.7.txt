2.7 Discrete or continuous 2 
Identify each of the following variables as continuous or discrete.
a. The number of courses for which a student has received credit

b. The total playing time of a playlist on Spotify

c. The distance between where you live and your classroom, when you measure it precisely with values such as 0.5 km, 2.5 km, and 5.65 km

d. The amount of money in your pocket (Hint: You could regard a number such as €10.25 as 1,025 in terms of “the number of cents”.)
-----------------

a. Discrete - Courses are counted in whole numbers.

b. Continuous - Playing time can be measured in very fine units like seconds or milliseconds.

c. Continuous - Distance is measurable with infinite precision (e.g., decimals like 0.5 km, 2.53 km).

d. Discrete - Money, when measured in cents (or the smallest currency unit), is counted and cannot be 
split further in practical terms. So it’s treated as discrete.
