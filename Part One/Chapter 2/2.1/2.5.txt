2.5 Discrete/continuous
a. Explain the difference between a discrete variable and a continuous variable.
b. Give an example of each type.
------------

a.  A discrete variable is one that takes on countable values, usually whole numbers. 
These values are separated and not connected - for example, 0, 1, 2, 3...

A continuous variable can take on any value within a range, including decimals and fractions. 
These values form a continuous scale â€” such as 0.125, 1.5, or 3.3336.

b. An example of a discrete variable is the number of stop losses or take profits triggered during the day - these are countable events.

An example of a continuous variable is the time spent in a trade, which can be any value (e.g., 2.5 minutes, 7.75 hours), 
and is measured on a continuous scale.
