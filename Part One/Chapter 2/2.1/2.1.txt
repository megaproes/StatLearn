2.1 Categorical/quantitative difference
a. Explain the difference between categorical and quantitative variables.
b. Give an example of each.

Categorical variables classify data into distinct groups or categories, such as “yes” or “no,” or “short,” “long,” or “neutral.”
They describe qualities or labels, not numbers.

Quantitative variables represent numerical values that can be measured or counted. 
They describe magnitudes and allow for mathematical operations such as averaging.

b. .
Examples of quantitative variables include:
    MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion)
    MPP (Maximum Profit Potential)
    Duration or PNL of trades

Examples of categorical variables include:
    “Was cold-minded during trade: Yes/No”
    “Bitcoin state: Long / Short / Range-bound”
