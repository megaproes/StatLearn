2.87 Dealer markup for cars 

The lot of a car dealership contains cars with an average invoice price (thatâ€™s the price the dealer paid the manufacturer) 
of $45,000, with a standard deviation of $10,000. 

The median invoice price was $40,000. To protect its profits, the dealership decides to set the sales price 20% higher than the invoice price for each of its cars.
a. What is the mean of the sales prices for the cars on the lot?
b. What is the median of the sales prices for the cars on the lot?
c. What is the standard deviation of the sales prices for the cars on the lot?
----------

Using the transformation y = 1.2x (sales price is 20% higher than invoice price):
a. Mean = 1.2 * $45,000 = $54,000

b. Median = 1.2 * $40,000 = $48,000

c. Standard deviation = 1.2 * $10,000 = $12,000

When multiplying all data values by a constant (1.2 in this case), all measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation) 
are multiplied by that same constant, while the shape of the distribution remains unchanged.
