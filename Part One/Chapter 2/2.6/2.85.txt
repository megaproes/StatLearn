2.85 Boosting scores after difficult exam 

Scores on a difficult statistics exam have a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 10.

a. The teacher considers boosting the scores by adding 10 points to all exams. What is the mean and what is
the standard deviation of the scores after the 10 points are added to each student’s score?

b. Suppose instead the teacher considers increasing each student’s score by 10%. What is the mean and what is the standard deviation of the adjusted scores now?

c. The teacher decides to boost each student’s score by first increasing each score by 5% and then adding a constant of 10 points. 
Find the mean and standard deviation of the boosted scores.

d. If the distribution of the original scores was left-skewed, what is the shape of the distribution of the boosted scores?

e. If the teacher wanted to just bring the average score from 60 up to 80 points, without changing the standard deviation, how should the teacher adjust each student’s score?
------------------

a. Using transformation y = x + 10 (adding 10 points):

Mean = 60 + 10 = 70
Standard deviation = 10 (unchanged when adding a constant)

b. Using transformation y = 1.1x (increasing by 10%):

Mean = 1.1 × 60 = 66
Standard deviation = 1.1 × 10 = 11

c. Using transformation y = 10 + 1.05x (first increase by 5%, then add 10):

Mean = 10 + 1.05 × 60 = 73
Standard deviation = 1.05 × 10 = 10.5

d. The distribution remains left-skewed. Linear transformations preserve the shape of the distribution.

e. Add 20 points to each score (y = x + 20). This increases the mean from 60 to 80 while keeping the standard deviation unchanged at 10.
