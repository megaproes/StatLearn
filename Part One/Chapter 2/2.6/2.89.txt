Based on the z-score analysis, The Imitation Game would rank as the most highly rated movie overall.

The Imitation Game has the highest average z-score ((0.12 + 1.25)/2 = 0.685) and is the only movie that performs exceptionally well 
with users (z = 1.25, meaning it's 1.25 standard deviations above the typical user rating). 

While Inside Out has a higher critics' z-score (0.92), it performs only averagely with users (z = 0.42). 

Even though Inside Out has higher raw scores ((98.0 + 90.0) / 2 = 94 vs (90 + 92)/2 = 91 for Imitation Game), the standardized scores reveal the 
true relative performance by accounting for the different rating patterns between critics and users. 

The z-scores show that The Imitation Game achieved a more balanced excellence across both groups, making it genuinely more impressive when we 
consider how each group typically rates movies.
