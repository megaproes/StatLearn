2.88 Taxes and fees at Quickr 

Prices for a sample of used dishwashers on the website www.quickr.com have a mean of $24,200 and standard deviation of $2,860.

a. Prices quoted on www.quickr.com are without Goods and Service Tax (GST). To account for this, a GST of 28% is applied to the prices 
of all dishwashers in the sample. How are the mean and standard deviation of the prices affected?

b. In addition to the GST, Quickr adds a $599 processing fee when a dishwasher is sold through its webpage.
How are the mean and standard deviation of prices affected when both GST and fee are taken into account?
--------

a. With 28% GST applied: Using transformation y = 1.28x:

Mean = 1.28 × $24,200 = $30,976
std  = 1.28 × $2,860  = $3,660.80

b. With both 28% GST and $599 processing fee: Using transformation y = 1.28x + 599:

Mean = 1.28 * $24,200 + $599 = $30,976 + $599 = $31,575
std  = 1.28 * $2,860 = $3,660.80

The processing fee increases the mean by $599 but does not affect the standard deviation, since adding a constant to all values shifts 
the distribution but doesn't change its spread.
