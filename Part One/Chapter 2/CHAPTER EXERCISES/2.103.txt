2.103 Chad voting problems 

The 2000 U.S. presidential election had various problems in Florida. One was overvotes—people mistakenly voting for more than one presidential candidate. 
(There were multiple minor-party candidates.) There were 110,000 overvote ballots, with Al Gore marked on 84,197 and George W. Bush on 37,731. These ballots were disqualified. 

Was overvoting related to the design of the ballot? The figure shows MINITAB dot plots of the overvote percentages for 65 Florida counties organized by the type of voting machine—optical
scanning, Votomatic (voters manually punch out chads), and Datavote (voter presses a lever that punches out the
chad mechanically)—and the number of columns on the ballot (1 or 2).

a. The overvote was highest (11.6%) in Gadsden County. Identify the number of columns and the method of registering the vote for that county.
b. Of the six ballot type and method combinations, which two seemed to perform best in terms of having relatively low percentages of overvotes?
c. How might these data be summarized further by a bar graph with six bars?
----------

a. Looking at the rightmost dot at 11.6%, this appears to be in the Votomatic_2 row.

b.  One column with either optical scanning or votomatic. 

c. Create a bar graph with 6 bars, one for each combination:

1. Optical_1, Optical_2
2. Votomatic_1, Votomatic_2
3. Datavote_1, Datavote_2

Each bar's height would show the average overvote percentage for counties using that specific ballot/machine combination, making it easier to compare performance across all six scenarios.
