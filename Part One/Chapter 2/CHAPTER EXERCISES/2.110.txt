2.110 What shape do you expect? 

For the following variables, indicate whether you would expect its histogram to be bell shaped, skewed to the right, or skewed to the left. Explain why.

a. Number of times arrested in past year
b. Time needed to complete difficult exam (maximum time is 1 hour)
c. Assessed value of house
d. Age at death
-------------

a. Right-skewed - most people (the vast majority) have 0 arrests, with decreasing frequencies for 1, 2, 3+ arrests.

b. Left-skewed - few students finish very quickly, most take close to the full hour, with the tail extending toward shorter completion times.

c. Right-skewed - most houses have moderate values, with a long tail of expensive properties extending to the right.

d. Left-skewed - most deaths occur at older ages (70s, 80s, 90s), with fewer deaths at younger ages creating a tail extending toward lower ages (left side).
