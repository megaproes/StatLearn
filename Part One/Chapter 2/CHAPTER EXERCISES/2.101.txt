a. Is Region of Birth quantitative or categorical? Show how to summarize results by adding a column of percentages to the table.
b. Which of the following is a sensible numerical summary for these data: Mode (or modal category), mean, median? Explain, and report whichever is/are sensible.
c. How would you order the Region of Birth categories for a Pareto chart? What’s its advantage over the ordinary bar graph?
----------

a. Region of Birth is a categorical variable because it describes group membership, not a numeric value.
To summarize the data, we can add a percentage column** by dividing each region’s number by the total (2,568) and multiplying by 100. For example:

| Region of Birth           | Number (in Thousands) | Percentage (%)              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Africa                    | 115                   | (115 / 2,568) × 100 ≈ 4.48% |
| Asia                      | 590                   | ≈ 22.97%                    |
| Europe                    | 148                   | ≈ 5.76%                     |
| Latin America & Caribbean | 1,666                 | ≈ 64.89%                    |
| Other                     | 49                    | ≈ 1.91%                     |
| Total                     | 2,568                 | 100%                        |

b. For categorical data, the most appropriate numerical summary is the mode (or modal category), because it tells us which category is most frequent.
Here, the mode is Latin America & Caribbean, which has the highest number of young noncitizens.
Mean and median are not meaningful for categorical variables.
---

c. To make a Pareto chart, we will need to sort the regions in descending order by frequency:

1. Latin America & Caribbean (1,666)
2. Asia (590)
3. Europe (148)
4. Africa (115)
5. Other (49)

A Pareto chart is a bar graph where categories are ordered from most to least frequent. 
The advantage is that it makes it easy to see which categories contribute the most to the total and helps focus attention on the most significant contributors.
