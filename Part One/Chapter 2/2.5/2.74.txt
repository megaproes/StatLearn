2.74 Central Park temperature distribution revisited 
Exercise 2.29 showed a histogram for the distribution of Central Park annual average temperatures. The box plot for thesedata is shown here.

a. If this distribution is skewed, would you expect it to be skewed to the right or to the left? Explain.
b. Approximate each component of the five-number summary and interpret.
---------------

a. Based on the box plot, I would expect this distribution to be left-skewed (negatively skewed). Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion:
First, there are outliers on the left side of the distribution, indicating some unusually cold years that extend the tail toward lower temperatures. 
These outliers represent extreme values that pull the distribution's tail to the left.

Second, the left whisker appears longer than the right whisker, suggesting that the lowest 25% of annual temperatures are more spread out than the highest 25%. 
This asymmetry in the whisker lengths indicates more variability in the cooler temperatures.

Third, within the box itself, the median appears to be positioned closer to the third quartile than to the first quartile, which is another indicator of left skewness.
This pattern makes meteorological sense - while there may be a practical upper limit to how warm Central Park can get in a given year, unusually cold years 
(perhaps due to volcanic eruptions, solar cycles, or other climate anomalies) can create more extreme deviations below the typical range.

b. Reading from the box plot, the approximate five-number summary is:
Minimum: ~50°F (the leftmost outlier)
Q1: ~52.8°F (left edge of the box)
Median (Q2): ~54.2°F (the line inside the box)
Q3: ~55.2°F (right edge of the box)
Maximum: ~57.5°F (end of the right whisker)

Interpretation: This five-number summary reveals that Central Park's annual average temperatures are quite consistent, with the middle 50% of years falling within just 
a 2.4°F range (from about 52.8°F to 55.2°F). The median temperature of approximately 54.2°F represents the typical annual average. 

The presence of outliers around 50°F indicates that while most years cluster in the mid-50s, occasionally Central Park experiences significantly cooler annual averages, 
likely due to unusual weather patterns or climate events. 
The overall range spans about 7.5 degrees, showing that despite year-to-year variation, Central Park's climate remains relatively stable over time.
