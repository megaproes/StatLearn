2.71 Per Capita Income Asia 
The Net National Income Per Capita, 2017, published by Statista, showed national per capita income 
(national income divided by total population, in â€™000 USD) by country. 
For Asia, some of the values reported were: Nepal 0.78, Bangladesh 1.05, Pakistan 1.17, Myanmar 1.31, Bhutan 2.5, Indonesia 3.06, Philippines 3.19, Sri Lanka
3.63, Thailand 4.67, China 5.47, Malaysia 8.85, South Korea 21.71, Japan 39.31, and Singapore 44.58.

a. Find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).
b. Find the interquartile range (IQR). Interpret it.

a. Arranging the data in ascending order: {0.78, 1.05, 1.17, 1.31, 2.5, 3.06, 3.19, 3.63, 4.67, 5.47, 8.85, 21.71, 39.31, 44.58}
With 14 countries, we split the data into lower and upper halves:

Lower half: {0.78, 1.05, 1.17, 1.31, 2.5, 3.06, 3.19}
Upper half: {3.63, 4.67, 5.47, 8.85, 21.71, 39.31, 44.58}

Q1 (first quartile) = 1.31 thousand USD (the median of the lower half - Myanmar's income level)
Q3 (third quartile) = 8.85 thousand USD (the median of the upper half - Malaysia's income level)

b. The interquartile range is IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 8.85 - 1.31 = 7.54 thousand USD. This means that the middle 50% of Asian countries in this 
dataset have per capita incomes spanning a range of $7,540. In economic terms, this represents the income spread among "middle-tier" Asian economies, 
excluding both the poorest countries (like Nepal and Bangladesh) and the wealthiest (like Japan and Singapore). 

The IQR reveals substantial economic diversity even among the central group of Asian nations, with countries like Myanmar ($1,310 per capita) 
representing the lower boundary of typical middle-income Asia, while Malaysia ($8,850 per capita) represents the upper boundary. 

This $7,540 gap illustrates the significant economic development variations across the region, reflecting different stages of industrialization, 
natural resource endowments, and economic policies among Asian countries.
