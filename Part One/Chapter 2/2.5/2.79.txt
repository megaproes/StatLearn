2.79 Height of buildings 
For the 50 tallest buildings in Washington D.C., the mean was 195.57 ft., and the standard deviation was 106.32 ft. 
The tallest building in this sample had a height of 761 ft (www.skyscrapercenter.com).

a. Find the z-score for the height of 761 ft.
b. What does the positive sign for the z-score represent?
c. Is this observation a potential outlier according to the 3 standard deviation distance criteria? Explain.
----------------

a. z-score for the 761 ft building:
z = (761 - 195.57) / 106.32 = 565.43 / 106.32 = 5.32

b. The positive sign indicates that this building's height is above the mean. Specifically, it tells us the building is taller than the average height 
of the 50 tallest buildings in Washington D.C. Positive z-scores always indicate values above the mean, while negative z-scores indicate values below the mean.

c. Yes, this is definitely a potential outlier according to the 3 standard deviation criterion. 

With a z-score of 5.32, this building falls 5.32 standard deviations above the mean, which far exceeds the threshold of 3 standard deviations. 
This suggests the building is extraordinarily tall compared to the rest of the sample - even among the 50 tallest buildings in D.C., 
this one stands out as exceptionally high.
