2.72 Infant mortality Europe 

For Western Europe, the infant mortality rates reported by the Human Development Report 2006 were:
Sweden 3, Finland 3, Spain 3, Belgium 4, Denmark 4, France 4, Germany 4, Greece 4, Italy 4, Norway 4, Portugal 4, Netherlands 5, Switzerland 5, UK 5.

Show that Q1 = Q2 = Q3 = 4. (The quartiles, like the median, are less useful when the data are highly discrete.)
----------

Let me demonstrate that Q1 = Q2 = Q3 = 4 by working through the calculations systematically.

Ordered data: {3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5} (14 countries)

Finding Q1: Using the split-half method, the lower 7 values are {3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4}. The median of these 7 values is the 4th value = 4.

Finding Q2 (median): With 14 observations, the median is the average of the 7th and 8th values. Both positions contain the value 4, so Q2 = (4 + 4)/2 = 4.

Finding Q3: The upper 7 values are {4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5}. The median of these 7 values is the 4th value = 4.

Therefore: Q1 = Q2 = Q3 = 4

Why quartiles are less useful here: This example perfectly illustrates the limitation of quartiles with highly discrete data. 

When most observations cluster around a single value (in this case, 4 deaths per 1,000 births), the quartiles collapse to the same 
number and fail to reveal meaningful information about the distribution's spread.
