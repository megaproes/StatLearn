2.67 Studentsâ€™ shoe size 

Data collected over several years from college students enrolled in a business statistics class regarding their shoe size is numerically summarized by
x = 9.91, Q1 = 8, median = 10, Q3 = 11.
a. Interpret the quartiles.
b. Would you guess that the distribution is skewed or roughly symmetric? Why?
------------

a. The quartiles reveal interesting patterns in student shoe sizes. The first quartile of 8 indicates that 25% of students have shoe sizes below 8, 
representing those with smaller feet. The median of 10 shows that half the students wear sizes below 10, making this the typical shoe size in the class. 
The third quartile of 11 demonstrates that 75% of students wear sizes below 11, with only the largest 25% requiring sizes above this threshold. 
The interquartile range spans from 8 to 11, meaning the middle 50% of students fall within a relatively narrow 3-unit range of shoe sizes.

b. The distribution appears to be left-skewed (negatively skewed) based on several converging pieces of evidence. 
First, examining the quartile spacing reveals asymmetry: the distance from Q1 to the median (2 units) is twice as large as the distance from the median to Q3 (1 unit). 
This indicates that shoe sizes are more spread out below the median than above it, creating a longer tail extending toward smaller sizes. 

Second, the mean (9.91) is slightly lower than the median (10), which occurs when extreme values on the lower end pull the mean downward while the 
median remains relatively stable. This left skewness makes intuitive sense in the context of shoe sizes, where there's a natural lower boundary 
(people can't have extremely small adult shoe sizes), but the upper end can extend further, creating asymmetry in the distribution. 
The skewness likely reflects the inclusion of both male and female students, where the smaller shoe sizes of female students create the extended lower tail.
