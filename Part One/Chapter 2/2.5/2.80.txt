2.80 Marathon results 

The results for the first 20 finishers of the Women’s Marathon in the World Athletics Championships in Beijing in 2015 appears to have a
roughly bell-shaped distribution with a mean of 9073 seconds and a standard deviation of 161.4 seconds.

Among the first 20 runners to finish the race, the finishing time of the last finalist was 9377 seconds. Is this an unusual result? 
Answer by providing statistical justification. (Source: https://www.iaaf.org/.)
----------

For a bell-shaped distribution, we use z-scores to determine how unusual a result is:
z = (9377 - 9073) / 161.4 = 304 / 161.4 = 1.88

With a z-score of 1.88, the last finalist's time is not considered unusual. 
Here's the statistical justification:

Standard Rule: In bell-shaped distributions, values within ±2 standard deviations of the mean are considered typical or normal, 
while values beyond ±2 standard deviations are considered unusual.

Context: The z-score of 1.88 falls well within the ±2 range, indicating this finishing time is within the expected variation for elite marathon runners.

In a bell-shaped distribution, we expect about 95% of values to fall within ±2 standard deviations, so a z-score of 1.88 represents typical competitive variation.
