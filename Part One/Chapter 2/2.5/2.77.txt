2.77 European Union youth unemployment rates 
The 2013 unemployment rates of countries in the European Union app range from 4.9 to 27.3, with
Q1 = 7.2, median = 10.1, Q3 = 13.1, a mean of 11.1, and a standard deviation of 5.6.

a. In a box plot, what would be the values at the outer edges of the box, and what would be the values to which the whiskers extend? (To check your answers,
use the Explore Quantitative Data app.)

b. Which two countries will show up as outliers in the box plot? Why?

c. Greece had the highest unemployment rate of 27.3. Is it an outlier according to the 3 standard deviation criterion? Explain.

d. What unemployment value for a country would have a z-score equal to 0?
----------------

a. In the box plot:

Outer edges of the box: Q1 = 7.2% and Q3 = 13.1% (these form the left and right sides of the rectangular box)
Whisker extensions:

Left whisker extends to 4.9% (Austria - the minimum value, which is not an outlier)
Right whisker extends to 17.2% (Croatia - the highest non-outlier value within the upper fence of 21.95%)

b. Spain (26.4%) and Greece (27.3%) will show up as outliers because both exceed the upper fence of 21.95%. Using the 1.5 × IQR criterion:
IQR = 13.1 - 7.2 = 5.9
Upper boundary = 13.1 + 1.5(5.9) = 21.95%
Both Spain and Greece far exceed this threshold, making them clear outliers

c. Using the 3 standard deviation criterion for Greece:
z = (27.3 - 11.1) / 5.6 = 16.2 / 5.6 = 2.89 standard deviations
Greece is not an outlier according to the 3 standard deviation criterion, since 2.89 < 3.0. 

While Greece's unemployment rate is extremely high and stands out as unusual, it falls just short of the very strict 3-standard-deviation threshold. 
This demonstrates that different outlier criteria can give different results - Greece is an outlier by the 1.5 × IQR rule but not by the 3-standard-deviation rule.

d. A country with a z-score of 0 would have an unemployment rate exactly equal to the mean of 11.1%. The z-score formula is z = (value - mean) / standard deviation, so when z = 0, the value must equal the mean. This represents the "typical" or average unemployment rate among EU countries in 2013.
