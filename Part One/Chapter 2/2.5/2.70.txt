2.70 Traffic violations 

A company decides to examine the number of points its employees have accumulated in the
last two years on their driving record point system. A sample of 12 employees yields the following observations:
0 5 3 4 8 0 4 0 2 3 0 1

a. The standard deviation is 2.505. Find and interpret the range.

b. The quartiles are Q1 = 0, median = 2.5, Q3 = 4. Find the interquartile range.

c. Suppose the 2 was incorrectly recorded and is supposed to be 20. The standard deviation is then 5.625 but the quartiles do not change. Redo parts a and b with the
correct data and describe the effect of this outlier.
Which measure of variability, the range, IQR, or standard deviation is least affected by the outlier? Why?
---------------

a. Arranging the data in order: {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8}. The range is 8 - 0 = 8 points. 
This indicates that the spread between the most and least penalized employees spans 8 violation points. 
However, the range tells us nothing about the distribution of points among the middle employees - it only reflects the extreme cases.

b. The interquartile range is IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 4 - 0 = 4 points. This means that the middle 50% of employees have accumulated violation points within a 4-point range, 
providing a measure of typical variability that ignores the extreme cases (both the employees with no violations and those with the most violations).

c. With the corrected data (changing 2 to 20):
(a) The new range becomes 20 - 0 = 20 points, representing a 150% increase from the original range of 8 points. 
This dramatic change shows how a single extreme value can completely distort our understanding of the data's spread when using the range.

(b) The IQR remains exactly the same at 4 points because the quartiles are unchanged. 
The outlier (20 points) falls in the upper 25% of the data, so it doesn't affect the boundaries of the middle 50%.

Impact Analysis: The IQR is the least affected by the outlier, remaining completely unchanged while the range increases by 150% and the standard deviation 
more than doubles (from 2.505 to 5.625). This occurs because the IQR focuses exclusively on the middle 50% of the data and completely ignores extreme values. 
The quartiles that define the IQR (Q1 and Q3) are determined by positions in the ordered data rather than actual values, making them inherently resistant to outliers.
