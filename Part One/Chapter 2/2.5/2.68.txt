2.68 Ways to measure variability 
The standard deviation, the range, and the interquartile range (IQR) summarize the variability of the data.
a. Why is the standard deviation s usually preferred over the range?
b. Why is the IQR sometimes preferred to s?
c. What is an advantage of s over the IQR?

a. The standard deviation is usually preferred over the range because it provides a much more comprehensive and stable measure of variability. 
While the range depends entirely on just two values (the minimum and maximum), the standard deviation incorporates information from every single data point, 
giving a complete picture of how the data spreads around the mean. 
This makes the standard deviation far less vulnerable to the influence of a single extreme outlier. 

For example, if one unusually high or low value appears in your dataset, it can dramatically change the range while having a more moderate effect 
on the standard deviation. 

Additionally, the range provides no information about how the data is distributed between the extremes, 
whereas the standard deviation reflects the overall pattern of variation throughout the entire dataset.

b. The IQR is sometimes preferred to the standard deviation when dealing with skewed distributions or datasets containing outliers. 
Since the IQR focuses exclusively on the middle 50% of the data (from the 25th to 75th percentiles), it completely ignores extreme values that 
might not represent typical variability. 

This makes the IQR particularly valuable when analyzing income data, real estate prices, or any measurements  where a few extreme observations 
could distort our understanding of typical variation. The IQR gives us a clear picture of variability among the "typical" observations without being 
influenced by unusual cases that might be due to measurement errors, special circumstances, or represent fundamentally different populations.

c. A key advantage of the standard deviation over the IQR is its mathematical properties that enable advanced statistical analysis. 
The standard deviation works seamlessly with the normal distribution and many other theoretical distributions, allowing us to make precise probability 
calculations and confidence interval estimates. 
For instance, in a normal distribution, we know that approximately 68% of data falls within one standard deviation  of the mean, 
and 95% falls within two standard deviations. 

The IQR doesn't provide these kinds of probabilistic insights. Additionally, the standard deviation is essential for many advanced statistical procedures 
like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and quality control processes. 
While the IQR tells us about the spread of the middle half of our data, the standard deviation enables us to make predictions, set control limits, 
and perform the mathematical operations that underpin much of statistical inference.
