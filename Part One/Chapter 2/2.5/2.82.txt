2.82 Airbnb prices by type of room 

Refer to the previous exercise. When broken down by type of rental room (shared room, private room, entire apartment), the box plots for
each type of room are shown below. 

a. The median price for which type of room is the largest?
b. The variability in the prices is the largest for which type of room?
c. Is the distribution for the price of rooms for the rental type “shared room” left- or right-skewed or symmetric?
d. Write a short paragraph comparing the distribution of price across the three rental types. Go to the Explore
Quantitative Data app if you need specific values, such as medians, for your descriptions.
----------

a. Entire Apartment has the largest median price at $169, which makes economic sense since guests are renting an entire living space rather than sharing accommodations.

b. Entire Apartment shows the greatest variability with a standard deviation of $128.4, reflecting the wide range from basic studio apartments 
to luxury penthouses in premium Manhattan locations.

c. Shared Room prices are right-skewed. Evidence includes: the mean ($63.3) exceeding the median ($50.0), and from the histogram, we can see the distribution 
peaks early and has a long tail extending toward higher prices.
d. 
Pricing Hierarchy: The three rental types show a clear pricing hierarchy that reflects the level of privacy and space offered. Shared rooms (median $50) represent 
the most budget-friendly option, private rooms (median $75) offer moderate pricing with personal space, while entire apartments (median $169) command premium prices 
for complete privacy and independence.

Consistent Right Skewness: All three rental types exhibit right-skewed distributions, with means consistently exceeding medians: shared rooms ($63.3 vs $50.0), 
private rooms ($84.6 vs $75.0), and entire apartments ($201.6 vs $169.0). This pattern indicates that while most listings in each category cluster around 
affordable price points, luxury options create extended upper tails in all segments.

Variability Patterns: Entire apartments show the greatest price variability (std = $128.4), reflecting the diversity from basic studios to luxury accommodations. 
Interestingly, shared and private rooms have similar standard deviations ($57.5 and $54.7 respectively), but their IQRs differ significantly (40 vs 44), suggesting 
different outlier patterns. Despite the $1,000 maximum appearing across all categories, the typical price ranges (Q1 to Q3) are quite distinct: $35-$75 for shared rooms, 
$55-$99 for private rooms, and $125-$239 for entire apartments.

Market Insight: This analysis reveals that NYC's Airbnb market successfully segments travelers by budget and privacy preferences, 
with each category offering both accessible and luxury options while maintaining distinct price positioning.
