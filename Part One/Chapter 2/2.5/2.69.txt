2.69 Variability of net worth of billionaires 

Here is the five-number summary for the distribution of the net worth
(in billions) of the 659 top Worldâ€™s Billionaires according to Forbes magazine.
Minimum = 2.9, Q1 = 3.6, Median = 4.8, Q3 = 8.2, Maximum = 79.2

a. About what proportion of billionaires have wealth (i) greater than $3.6 billion and (ii) greater than $8.2 billion?
b. Between which two values are the middle 50% of the observations found?
c. Find the interquartile range. Interpret it.
d. Based on the summary, do you think that this distribution was bell shaped? If so, why? If not, why not, and what shape would you expect?
--------------

a. 
(i) Since Q1 = $3.6 billion represents the 25th percentile, approximately 75% of billionaires have wealth greater than $3.6 billion. 
(ii) Since Q3 = $8.2 billion represents the 75th percentile, approximately 25% of billionaires have wealth greater than $8.2 billion.

b. The middle 50% of billionaires have net worth between $3.6 billion (Q1) and $8.2 billion (Q3). 
This means half of all billionaires fall within this wealth range, representing the "typical" wealth levels among the world's billionaires.

c. The interquartile range is IQR = Q3 - Q1 = $8.2 - $3.6 = $4.6 billion. 
This tells us that the middle 50% of billionaires' wealth spans a range of $4.6 billion, providing a measure of variability that isn't 
affected by the extreme wealth of the richest billionaires or those at the lower end of the billionaire threshold.

d. This distribution is definitely not bell-shaped; instead, it appears to be strongly right-skewed (positively skewed). 
Several pieces of evidence support this conclusion: First, the median ($4.8 billion) is much closer to Q1 ($3.6 billion) than to Q3 ($8.2 billion), 
indicating that wealth values are compressed in the lower range and more spread out in the upper range. 

Second, the distance from Q1 to the median is only $1.2 billion, while the distance from the median to Q3 is $3.4 billion - nearly three times larger. 
Most telling, the maximum value of $79.2 billion is extraordinarily far from Q3, creating an extremely long right tail. This shape makes perfect sense for wealth data, 
where there's a natural lower boundary (you need at least a few billion to be on the list) but virtually no upper limit, allowing a few individuals like tech moguls 
and oil magnates to accumulate vastly more wealth than typical billionaires. 

The right-skewed distribution reflects the reality that while most billionaires cluster in the lower billions, a few exceptional cases extend far into the tens of billions.
