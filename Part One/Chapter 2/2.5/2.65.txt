2.65 Youth unemployment 
For the 28 EU nations, the following table shows the unemployment rate among 15- to 24-year-olds in 2013. 

If you are computing the statistics below by hand, it may be easier to arrange the data in increasing order and write them in four rows of seven values each.
a. Find and interpret the second quartile (median).
b. Find and interpret the first quartile (Q1).
c. Find and interpret the third quartile (Q3).
d. Will the 10th percentile be around the value of 6 or 16? Explain.

        Belgium               8.4
        Estonia               8.6
       Slovenia              10.1
        Hungary              10.2
         France              10.3
         Poland              10.3
      Lithuania              11.8
         Latvia              11.9
          Italy              12.2
       Bulgaria              13.0
        Ireland              13.1
       Slovakia              14.2
         Cyprus              15.9
       Portugal              16.5
        Croatia              17.2
          Spain              26.4
         Greece              27.3

a. The median (second quartile) is the average of the 14th and 15th values in the ordered dataset. 
These are Hungary (10.2) and France (10.3), giving us a median of (10.2 + 10.3)/2 = 10.25%. 
This tells us that half of the 28 EU nations had youth unemployment rates below 10.25%, while the other half experienced rates above this threshold.

b. The first quartile (Q1) is the average of the 7th and 8th values: Denmark (7.0) and Romania (7.3). Therefore, Q1 = (7.0 + 7.3)/2 = 7.15%. 
This indicates that 25% of EU nations maintained relatively low youth unemployment rates at or below 7.15%, representing the countries 
with the most successful youth employment policies.

c. The third quartile (Q3) is the average of the 21st and 22nd values: Ireland (13.1) and Slovakia (14.2). Therefore, Q3 = (13.1 + 14.2)/2 = 13.65%. 
This means that 75% of EU nations had youth unemployment rates below 13.65%, while the remaining 25% struggled with particularly high rates above this level.

d. The 10th percentile will be around 6 rather than 16. Here's the reasoning: with 28 countries, the 10th percentile represents the point below which 10% of the data falls. Ten percent of 28 is 2.8 countries, so we're looking at approximately the position of the 3rd lowest value. 
The three lowest unemployment rates are Austria (4.9%), Germany (5.3%), and Luxembourg (5.8%). 

The 10th percentile would fall near Luxembourg's value of 5.8%, which is much closer to 6 than to 16. 
A value of 16 would actually be closer to the 75th percentile, given that most countries cluster in the lower ranges with only a few outliers like 
Spain and Greece having extremely high rates
