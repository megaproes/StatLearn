2.76 Energy statistics 

The Energy Information Administration records per capita consumption of energy by country. The following box plot shows 2011 per
capita energy consumption (in millions of BTUs) for 36 OECD countries, with a mean of 195 and a standard deviation of 120. 
Iceland had the largest per capita consumption at 665 million BTU.

a. Use the box plot to give approximate values for the five-number summary of energy consumption. (You can reconstruct the box plot with the app.)

b. Italy had a per capita consumption of 139 million BTU. How many standard deviations from the mean was its consumption?

c. The United States was not included in the data, but its per capita consumption was 334 million BTU. Relative to the distribution for the included OECD nations, the
United States is how many standard deviations from the mean?
---------------

a. Reading from the box plot, the approximate five-number summary is:

Minimum: ~50 million BTU
Q1: ~140 million BTU
Median (Q2): ~150 million BTU
Q3: ~240 million BTU
Maximum: ~400 million BTU (end of whisker, not including the outlier)

b. To find how many standard deviations Italy's consumption was from the mean:
z = (Italy's consumption - mean) / standard deviation
z = (139 - 195) / 120 = -56 / 120 = -0.47 standard deviations
Italy's per capita energy consumption was 0.47 standard deviations below the mean, indicating below-average energy use compared to other OECD countries.

c. For the United States:
z = (US consumption - mean) / standard deviation
z = (334 - 195) / 120 = 139 / 120 = 1.16 standard deviations

The United States' per capita energy consumption was 1.16 standard deviations above the mean. 

This indicates that US energy consumption  is notably higher than the typical OECD country, though not as extreme as Iceland's consumption.
