--------------

The distribution is clearly right skewed, meaning most of data cluster towards lower values. 
This confirms lots of outrliers towards higher values as well as the median being closer to Q1 that to Q3.
-------------

Central Tendency: The mean ($139.50) is notably higher than the median ($100.00), which is a classic indicator of right skewness. 
This 40% difference suggests that high-priced outliers are pulling the mean upward while the median remains anchored closer to the typical experience.

Variability and Range: With a standard deviation of $113.80 and an IQR of $105.00, there's considerable price variation. 
The dramatic range from $10 to $1,000 further emphasizes the presence of both budget and ultra-luxury options, though the vast majority cluster in the lower price ranges.

Shape Characteristics: The histogram shows the classic right-skewed pattern with a sharp peak in the $0-$100 range (containing over 15,000 of the 28,489 rooms) 
and a long tail extending toward higher prices. 
The box plot reinforces this pattern, with the median positioned much closer to Q1 ($70) than to Q3 ($175), and extensive outliers stretching across the upper price ranges.
