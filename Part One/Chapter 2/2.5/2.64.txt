2.64 Vacation days 

National Geographic Traveler magazine recently presented data on the annual number of vacation
days averaged by residents of eight countries. 
They reported 42 days for Italy, 37 for France, 35 for Germany, 34 for Brazil, 28 for Britain, 26 for Canada, 25 for Japan, and 13 for the United States.

a. Report the median.
b. By finding the median of the four values below the median, report the first quartile.
c. Find the third quartile.
d. Interpret the values found in parts aâ€“c in the context of these data.

a. Arranging the data in ascending order: {13, 25, 26, 28, 34, 35, 37, 42}. 
With 8 observations, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values: (28 + 34)/2 = 31 vacation days.

b. The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the four values below the overall median {13, 25, 26, 28}. Therefore, Q1 = (25 + 26)/2 = 25.5 vacation days.

c. The third quartile (Q3) is the median of the four values above the overall median {34, 35, 37, 42}. Therefore, Q3 = (35 + 37)/2 = 36 vacation days.

d. These quartiles reveal important patterns in international vacation policies. The median of 31 vacation days indicates that half of these eight countries 
provide fewer than 31 vacation days annually, while half provide more. 

The first quartile of 25.5 days shows that 25% of countries (in this case, the US and Japan) offer relatively few vacation days. 

The third quartile of 36 days indicates that 75% of countries provide 36 or fewer vacation days, with only the top 25% (Italy and France) exceeding this threshold. 

This analysis suggests significant variation in vacation policies across these nations, with the United States notably providing the fewest days at 13, 
far below even the first quartile.
