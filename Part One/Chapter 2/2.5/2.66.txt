2.66 Female strength 

The High School Female Athletes data file on the bookâ€™s website has data for 57 high school female athletes on the maximum number of pounds they were able to bench
press, which is a measure of strength. 

For these data, x_mean = 79.9, Q1 = 70, median = 80, Q3 = 90.
a. Interpret the quartiles.
b. Would you guess that the distribution is skewed or roughly symmetric? Why?
-----------------

a. The quartiles reveal the distribution of strength among these female athletes. The first quartile of 70 pounds indicates that 25% of athletes 
could bench press 70 pounds or less, representing the lower-strength group. The median of 80 pounds shows that exactly half the athletes could bench 
press 80 pounds or less, making this the typical performance level. 

The third quartile of 90 pounds demonstrates that 75% of athletes achieved 90 pounds or less, meaning only the strongest 25% exceeded this level. 
Together, these quartiles show that the middle 50% of athletes fall within a 20-pound range (70-90 pounds), suggesting relatively 
consistent strength levels among most participants.

b. The distribution appears to be roughly symmetric based on several key indicators. First, the distances between consecutive quartiles are equal: both the lower half 
(Q1 to median) and upper half (median to Q3) span exactly 10 pounds, suggesting balanced spread above and below the center. 

Second, the mean (79.9 pounds) and median (80 pounds) are nearly identical, differing by only 0.1 pounds. 
In skewed distributions, the mean typically gets pulled toward the longer tail, creating a noticeable gap between mean and median. 
The fact that these measures of central tendency are so close strongly suggests the distribution is symmetric. 
This symmetry makes sense for biological measurements like strength, which often follow roughly normal distributions in homogeneous populations 
like high school female athletes.
