2.73 Computer use 
During a recent semester at the University of Florida, students having accounts on a mainframe computer had storage space use 
(in kilobytes) described by the five-number summary, minimum = 4, Q1 = 256, median = 530, Q3 = 1,105, and maximum = 320,000.

a. Would you expect this distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the right, or skewed to the left? Explain.
b. Use the 1.5 * IQR criterion to determine whether any potential outliers are present.

a. This distribution is likely to be right-skewed (positively skewed) based on several compelling pieces of evidence. 
First, the maximum value of 320,000 kilobytes is extraordinarily large compared to the third quartile of 1,105 kilobytes, creating an extreme tail 
extending toward the higher values (the right side of the distribution). 

Second, examining the quartile spacing reveals asymmetry: the distance from Q1 to the median (530 - 256 = 274) is much smaller than the distance 
from the median to Q3 (1,105 - 530 = 575). This indicates that storage usage values are compressed in the lower range and more spread out in the upper range, 
which is the hallmark of right skewness. 

The pattern makes intuitive sense for computer storage usage - most students use modest amounts of storage for typical coursework, but a few users 
(perhaps those working with large datasets, multimedia projects, or extensive programming files) require dramatically more space, creating the characteristic long right tail.

b. Using the 1.5 Ã— IQR criterion to identify outliers: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 1,105 - 256 = 849 kilobytes
Outlier boundaries:

Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5(IQR) = 256 - 1.5(849) = -1,017.5 (effectively 0 since storage can't be negative)
Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = 1,105 + 1.5(849) = 2,378.5 kilobytes

Conclusion: The maximum value of 320,000 kilobytes far exceeds the upper fence of 2,378.5 kilobytes, making it a clear outlier. 
This extreme value is more than 134 times larger than the upper fence, representing students with exceptionally high storage usage that's fundamentally 
different from typical user patterns. The minimum value of 4 kilobytes falls well within the normal range, so no outliers exist on the lower end.
